## Contributing Code and Documentation

### Cloning the repository

1. Start by forking this repository. Either from github UI or their CLI:

    ```bash
    gh repo fork https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase
    ```

2. Then clone your fork:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/niledatabase.git
    cd niledatabase
    ```

### Directory Structure

To get started, it helps to be familiar with how this repository is layed out. Here's an overview of the key directories:

```bash
/
|-- www
   |-- app/docs
   |-- app/templates
|-- examples
    |-- quickstart
        |-- <language>
    |-- user_management
        |-- <feature>
           |-- <language>
```

As we can see, we have separate directories for our [website](./www/DEVELOPERS.md), [documentation](./www/app/docs//README.md), [templates](./www/app/templates/README.md) and [examples](./examples/README.md). Each is a bit different, so they each have a separate developer guide with more details on how to make changes and validate them locally.

### Creating a Pull Request

Once you have changes to contribute, please open a pull request from a branch in your fork to this repository, and we will review it promptly.

To make the review process more pleasant, please make sure the pull request includes:

- The type of change you are making (correcting a mistake in the docs, new document, fix an issue in an example, enhance an example)
