## Local development

Turborepo is used to manage and run this monorepo.

1. Install the dependencies in the root of the repo

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Built the website and docs initially:

   ```sh
   npm run build:www
   ```

3. Run the website and docs locally:

   ```sh
   npm run dev:www
   ```

4. Now you can make any change, fix or improvement you'd like and see the result locally.
