              These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any
              substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to
              the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by

              responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail
              address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have
              provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of
              delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the

              effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Continued

            </p>

            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section
              (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to
              arbitrate disputes with Company, its parent companies,
              subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns and all of their
              respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and
              representatives (collectively, the “Company Parties”) and limits
              the manner in which you can seek relief from the Company Parties.
            </p>

            <h4>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</h4>
            <p>
              You agree that any dispute between you and any of the Company
              Parties relating in any way to the Site, the services offered on
              the Site (the “Services”) or these Terms will be resolved by
              binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and
              the Company Parties may assert individualized claims in small
              claims court if the claims qualify, remain in such court and
              advance solely on an individual, non-class basis; and (2) you or
              the Company Parties may seek equitable relief in court for
              infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such
              as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets,
              copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall survive
              the expiration or termination of these Terms and shall apply,
              without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted
              before you agreed to these Terms or any prior version of these
              Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing
              issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. Such
              agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against the Company
              Parties on your behalf.
            </p>

            <h4>Informal Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>
              There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and
              Company. If that occurs, Company is committed to working with you
              to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Company agree that good
              faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt,
              low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Company
              therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration
              against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if
              a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer
              telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to
              resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration
              Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are
              represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the
              conference, but you will also participate in the conference.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Arbitration Agreement</h2>

          <p>
            The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party
            in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution
            Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 45 days after the
            other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually
            agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Company that you intend to
            initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by
            email to:{" "}
            <a href="mailto:contacts@thenile.dev">contacts@thenile.dev</a>, or
            by regular mail to PO Box 7775 PMB 99846, San Francisco, California
            94120. The Notice must include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address
              associated with your account (if you have one);
            </li>
            <li>
              (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address
              of your counsel, if any; and
            </li>
            <li>(3) a description of your Dispute.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized
            such that a separate conference must be held each time either party
            initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms
            represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties
            agree. Multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate
            in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all
            parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and
            the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this
            Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in
            informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute.
            Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a
            condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before
            commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing
            fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the
            Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this
            section.
          </p>

          <h2>Arbitration Rules and Forum</h2>

          <p>
            These Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce;
            and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the
            applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §
            1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
            Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the
            Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve
            satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and
            Company agree that either party shall have the right to finally
            resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The Federal
            Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
            Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an
            established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes
            involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy
            under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall

          <p>
            A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other
            party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request
            must include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>

              applicable account;
            </li>
            <li>

              bases of those claims;
            </li>
            <li>
              (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith
              calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars;
            </li>
            <li>
              (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute
              Resolution process as described above; and
            </li>
            <li>

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose,
              such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase
              the cost of dispute resolution;
            </li>
            <li>
              (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted
              by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending,
              modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support
              or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary
              support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation
              or discovery.
