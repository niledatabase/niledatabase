From the very early days of Nile, when we were still drawing ideas on a whiteboard and talking to SaaS companies to understand their 
journey, we knew that geographical distribution was an important requirement for SaaS businesses at almost every stage and that 
managing data across geographies is a recurring pain point. 
So we weren't surprised when one of the top requests from our customers was to make Nile available in additional regions.

Which is why we are excited to announce that today we are making Nile available in additional regions. 
We started with us-west-2 (Oregon) and you now have the option to also provision a database 
in eu-central-1 (Frankfurt). We are planning to add new regions in Singapore, Sydney and US East Coast in short order.
Need Nile anywhere else? Let us know. We've built an easy-to-expand control plane architecture, so we can spin up a new region 
in minutes. Just say the word.

There are a few reasons SaaS companies need their databases in different regions, long before they reach global scale:

### Latency 
This is probably a bit too obvious, but if your SaaS is serving mostly customers in the EU, they will experience much better 
performance if your application and your database is in the EU as well. For SaaS businesses that start out as regional, this is a 
“no brainer”. While the idea that bringing the data close to customers reduces latency is obvious, I discovered that developers 
often underestimate the impact of 100ms latency in each roundtrip on their application. Often applications make multiple database 
calls while loading a single page, and these add up. 

### Developer productivity
Even if your customers happen to be near Oregon, your developers may be in Europe, or all over the world. 
Customers aren't the only people who enjoy faster performance with a near-by database, so do developers. 
And developer happiness is important to the success of your SaaS business. 
With Serverless Postgres, you only pay for used capacity, so there is no reason why you shouldn't have a near by database 
for every developer on your team.

### Compliance
This one can catch startups by surprise. With self-serve signup, EU citizens can sign up to any SaaS. 
EU regulations make it a bit tricky to store private information about its citizen outside the EU. 
The customers need to consent to this, and there is a lot of confusion around what this consent entails.
A database in the EU makes compliance much easier.

## Using the new regions

Creating a database in a new region is as simple as selecting it in the dropdown when creating the database.

The database connection string in the existing "settings" page will have everything you need to connect to the new region.

When using Nile SDK in your application, you'll want to use the latest SDK version - 2.4.0 or later. 
We have significantly simplified the configuration you need to use to connect to Nile. 
In fact, all you need is your database credentials, and the SDK will automatically find your database - anywhere in the world.

Define your environment variables:

```bash
# get these values from console.thenile.dev credentials
NILEDB_USER=
NILEDB_PASSWORD=
```

And Nile will automatically configure itself to connect to the right database and API in the right region:

```javascript
const nile = await Nile();
```

You can find additional explanations and examples in our documentation.

## Soon: Global databases

Provisioning databases in any region you need is great, but Nile's tenant virtualization allows us to deliver truly global 
databases - with virtual tenant databases in every location. Soon, supporting customers in multiple countries will be as simple as:

```SQL
insert into tenants (name, region)
values ('customer 1', 'aws-us-east1');

insert into tenants (name, region)
values ('customer 2', 'aws-eu-west1');
```
