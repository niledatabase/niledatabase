};

The pgvector community shipped the much anticipated version 0.8.0 with significant performance and functionality improvements. 
Naturally, we couldn't wait to make it available to Nile users. 

## Release highlights (from the official pgvector changelog):

* Added support for iterative index scans
* Added casts for arrays to sparsevec
* Improved cost estimation for better index selection when filtering
* Improved performance of HNSW index scans
* Improved performance of HNSW inserts and on-disk index builds
* Dropped support for Postgres 12

The most anticipated feature is iterative index scanning, which addresses a longstanding challenge with vector indexes. 
Previously, filters were applied after the index scan completed, which often yielded fewer results than expected. According
to the pgvector documentation:

> With approximate indexes, filtering is applied after the index is scanned. If a condition matches 10% of rows,
> with HNSW and the default hnsw.ef_search of 40, only 4 rows will match on average.

Common workarounds include scanning more rows, using partial indexes, or partitioning, but these methods can be 
impractical or undesirable. The new iterative scan feature offers a more straightforward and intuitive solution:

1. Scan the vector index
2. Apply filter
3. Check if enough results are returned. If not, repeat the scan.

## Demonstrating iterative scans

Lets see this in action with a very small example. I strongly recommend running small experiments - you learn so 
much if the actual results don't match my expectations. Follow along for important pgvector lessons:

To start, I create a table with sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE filtest(id INTEGER, category INTEGER, embedding vector(3));
INSERT INTO filtest VALUES 
    (1, 1, '[3, 1, -2]'),
    (2, 1, '[3, 1, -2]'),
    (3, 1, '[3, 1, -2]'),
    (1, 2, '[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]'), 
    (2, 2, '[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]'),
    (3, 2, '[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]');
CREATE INDEX ON filtest USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

The table contains six rows divided into two categories. Vectors in category 2 closely resemble `[1, 2, 3]`, while vectors in 
category 1 differ significantly, representing **orthogonal** (unrelated) data.

What would you expect the following query to return?

```sql
select id, category, embedding<=>'[1,2,3]'  AS distance 
FROM filtest where category=1 
order by distance limit 3;
```

### Index scans in pgvector 0.7.4

I searched for 3 vectors, from category 1, that are closest to `[1,2,3]`, so the correct answer 
is to return all vectors from category 1. However, this is what I expected pgvector 0.7.4 to do:

1. Scan the vector index and find the 3 vectors closest to `[1,2,3]`, some of which should belong to category 2.
2. Filter the results and keep only vectors from category 1.
3. Return partial results.

However, in practice:

```sql
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
 extversion
------------
 0.7.4
(1 row)

select id, category, embedding<=>'[1,2,3]'  AS distance 
FROM filtest where category=1 order by distance limit 3;
 id | category |      distance
----+----------+--------------------
  3 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  1 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  2 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
```

Why are we seeing the correct results? Because pgvector's default configuration for the number of rows to scan in the 
vector index is 40. So the index scan returned the entire table, and after filtering, we got the right result. 
Thats the problem with small examples... if I tried with 100 vectors, it would have missed some results as expected.

Lets try with a tweaked configuration:

```sql
SET hnsw.ef_search = 3;
SET

select id, category, embedding<=>'[1,2,3]'  AS distance FROM filtest where category=1 order by distance limit 3;
 id | category |      distance
----+----------+--------------------
  3 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  2 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
(2 rows)
```

This is the partial result that I expected! 

### Iterative index scans in pgvector 0.8.0

Now lets see how the same query behaves in pgvector 0.8.0:

```sql
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';
 extversion
------------
 0.8.0

SET hnsw.ef_search = 3;
SET

 select id, category, embedding<=>'[1,2,3]'  AS distance FROM filtest where category=1 order by distance limit 3;
 id | category |      distance
----+----------+--------------------
  1 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  2 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  3 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
(3 rows)
```

Great! pgvector 0.8.0 delivers! Yes, but not in the way you think:

```sql
show hnsw.iterative_scan;
 hnsw.iterative_scan
---------------------
 off
(1 row)
```

Oops! `hnsw.iterative_scan` is disabled. So how did it still work? 
Use of `explain plan` shows that the index wasn't used:

```sql
explain select id, category, embedding<=>'[1,2,3]'  AS distance 
FROM filtest where category=1 order by distance limit 3;
                             QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=25.09..25.10 rows=3 width=16)
   ->  Sort  (cost=25.09..25.11 rows=6 width=16)
         Sort Key: ((embedding <=> '[1,2,3]'::vector))
         ->  Seq Scan on filtest  (cost=0.00..25.02 rows=6 width=16)
               Filter: (category = 1)
(5 rows)
```

This is due to a different improvement in pgvector 0.8.0:

> Improved cost estimation for better index selection when filtering

It is really silly to use a vector index when scanning a 6-row table. So with the improved cost estimation, 
it no longer happens.

This is good news, but I really want to check the iterative scan. So lets force the use of index and try again:

```sql
set enable_seqscan=false; -- force use of index, don't do this in production!

select id, category, embedding<=>'[1,2,3]'  AS distance 
FROM filtest where category=1 order by distance limit 3;
 id | category |      distance
----+----------+--------------------
  2 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  3 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
(2 rows)

SET hnsw.iterative_scan = relaxed_order; -- enable iterative scan
SET

select id, category, embedding<=>'[1,2,3]'  AS distance 
FROM filtest where category=1 order by distance limit 3;
 id | category |      distance
----+----------+--------------------
  2 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  3 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
  1 |        1 | 1.0714285714285714
(3 rows)
```

And we can see that pgvector 0.8.0 and iterative scans work as expected. As a bonus, we also saw the cost optimization in action, 
and learned about `hnsw.ef_search` query configuration.

If you are a Nile user, you already have pgvector 0.8.0, so I recommend taking advantage of it. Head over to our [documentation](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/ai-embeddings/pg_vector#iterative-index-scans) 
for detailed explanation of iterative_scan options, and fancy optimizations.
