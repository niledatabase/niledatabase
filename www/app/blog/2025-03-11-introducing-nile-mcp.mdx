We are excited to announce the launch of [Nile MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server.](https://github.com/niledatabase/nile-mcp-server) The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. The Nile MCP supports an extensive set of tools, and we have many plans for the future. The MCP server works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, and Windsurf and can be invoked in a standalone mode. It supports both the STDIO and SSE modes of transport. [Try out the Nile MCP server](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/ai-embeddings/model_context_protocol) today. We would love your feedback.

## How to think about MCP?

I've encountered many questions about what an MCP is and whether it is useful. One way to understand MCPs is to compare them to the USB port on your laptop. Your laptop can access all the data on its internal storage, but it cannot access data from external devices unless they are connected. When you plug in an external device via the USB port, your laptop can access the data on that device as if it were always a part of its system.

The relationship between a Large Language Model (LLM) and MCPs is quite similar. The LLM has access to the data it was trained on but lacks access to data silos in SaaS services or enterprise databases. MCPs provide a standard way to expose this external data to the LLM. Once the LLM has access to the MCPs, it can utilize them like an extended data source to answer queries, seamlessly integrating the information.

The benefit of standardizing the protocol is to build the MCP once and make it available to every tool in the LLM ecosystem. The standardization also helps build an ecosystem around MCPs, including packaging, discovery, deployment, communication, etc. Without a standard protocol, we will have many bespoke solutions and repeated implementations.

## **Installation and Configuration**

Install the stable version:

```bash
npm install @niledatabase/nile-mcp-server
```

For the latest alpha/preview version:

```bash
npm install @niledatabase/nile-mcp-server@alpha
```

**Configuration**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Nile credentials. If you are setting up Claude Desktop or Cursor, you will pass this in the configuration file.

```bash
NILE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NILE_WORKSPACE_SLUG=your_workspace_slug
```

To create a Nile API key, log in to your [Nile account](https://console.thenile.dev/), click Workspaces in the top-left, select your workspace, and navigate to the Security section in the left menu.

## Using with Cursor, Claude Desktop, Winsurf or Cline

### Setting up Cursor

1. Go to Preferences > Cursor Settings (⌘,) > MCP
2. Click "Add New MCP Server"
3. Configure the server:
- Name: `nile-database` (or any name you prefer)
- Type: Command
- Command to run

  ```bash
  env NILE_API_KEY=your_key NILE_WORKSPACE_SLUG=your_workspace 
  node /absolute/path/to/nile-mcp-server/dist/index.js
  ```

     - `your_key` with your Nile API key
     - `your_workspace` with your Nile workspace slug
     - `/absolute/path/to` with the actual path to your project

4. Click "Save"
5. You should see a green indicator showing that the MCP server is connected
6. Restart Cursor for the changes to take effect

Once you have setup Cursor, you should be able to open the chat in agent mode and start asking questions to any database in the Nile workspace.

### Setting up Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > MCP Servers
3. Click "Add Server"
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nile-database": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/nile-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NILE_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "NILE_WORKSPACE_SLUG": "your_workspace_slug"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace:

- `/path/to/your/nile-mcp-server` with the absolute path to your project directory
- `your_api_key_here` with your Nile API key
- `your_workspace_slug` with your Nile workspace slug

You can look at the [docs](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/ai-embeddings/model_context_protocol) to configure other IDEs like Windsurf or Cline to setup the MCP server.

## **Server Transport Modes**

The server supports two operational modes:

### STDIO Mode (Default)

The default mode uses standard input/output for communication, making it compatible with Claude Desktop and Cursor integrations. The examples of Cursor and Claude above shows this mode. The STDIO. mode is the most popular option today.

### SSE Mode

MCP also supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) mode that enables real-time, event-driven communication over HTTP. Nile MCP server supports this.

To enable SSE mode:

1. Set `MCP_SERVER_MODE=sse` in your `.env` file
2. The server will start an HTTP server (default port 3000)
3. Connect to the SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/sse`
4. Send commands to: `http://localhost:3000/messages`

Example SSE usage with curl:

In terminal 1 - Listen for events
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:3000/sse
```

In terminal 2 - Send commands

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/messages \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
"type": "function",
"name": "list-databases",
"parameters": {}
}'
```

## Example Prompts

After setting up the MCP server in Cursor, you can use natural language to interact with Nile databases. Here are some example prompts:

**Database Management**

```
Create a new database named "my_app" in AWS_US_WEST_2 region

List all my databases

Get details for database "my_app"

Delete database "test_db"

```

**Creating Tables**

```sql
Create a users table in my_app database with columns:
- tenant_id (UUID, references tenants)
- id (INTEGER)
- email (VARCHAR, unique per tenant)
- name (VARCHAR)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Create a products table in my_app database with columns:
- tenant_id (UUID, references tenants)
- id (INTEGER)
- name (VARCHAR)
- price (DECIMAL)
- description (TEXT)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

```

**Querying Data**

```sql
Execute this query on my_app database:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE tenant_id = 'your-tenant-id' LIMIT 5

Run this query on my_app:
INSERT INTO users (tenant_id, id, email, name)
VALUES ('tenant-id', 1, 'user@example.com', 'John Doe')

Show me all products in my_app database with price > 100

```

**Schema Management**

```
Show me the schema for the users table in my_app database

Add a new column 'status' to the users table in my_app database

Create an index on the email column of the users table in my_app

```

Nile MCP server is just the start in introducing more AI driven use cases in Nile. We think it should be possible to support many future use cases with the MCP including agentic workflows.

We're excited to see what you'll build with Nile MCP! Share your experiences, feedback, and questions with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nile) or [GitHub](https://github.com/niledatabase/cli).
