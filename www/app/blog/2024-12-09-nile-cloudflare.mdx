};

We are excited to announce Nile's integration with [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Cloudflare Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/).

**Cloudflare Workers** enables you to deploy serverless functions or even entire application backends globally, drastically reducing latency between your application and users for a smoother experience. Meanwhile, **Cloudflare Hyperdrive** acts as a caching proxy, accelerating database access for Cloudflare Workers to deliver exceptional speed and performance.

With this integration, you can build B2B applications and effortlessly deploy them worldwide, ensuring top-notch performance and an outstanding user experience.

## Why use Nile database with Cloudflare?

- **Global Scale**  
  Deploy your B2B applications worldwide using Cloudflare Workers, while Nile ensures tenant isolation, auth-scaling and tenant insights.

- **Accelerated Performance**  
  Leverage Cloudflare Hyperdrive to accelerate database queries, making interactions lightning-fast for your users.

- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**  
  Nile's tenant-aware architecture ensures that your customers' data is securely isolated, enabling you to build scalable and compliant apps effortlessly.

- **Simplified Deployment**  
  Combine Nile's serverless Postgres with Cloudflare's edge network to streamline the deployment of modern B2B applications with less operational overhead.

- **Optimized for AI Workloads**  
  Build AI-driven, multi-tenant applications with Nile and deploy them globally with Cloudflare. This architecture will minimize latency while easily scaling to millions of embeddings.

## Using Nile and Cloudflare together

**1. Create a database**  
[Login to Nile](https://console.thenile.dev), create a database, create the tables you need and grab a connection string with credentials.

**2. Create or clone a serverless app**  
It is easy to start with an existing [example](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/tree/main/examples/integrations/cloudflare):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase
cd niledatabase/examples/integrations/cloudflare/
```

This example uses Hono, a lightweight web framework, and Drizzle, a lightweight ORM, to build a multi-tenant todo list app.

**3. Create Hyperdrive configuration**  
Configure Cloudflare Hyperdrive with the connection string you got from Nile:

```bash
npx wrangler hyperdrive create your_config_name \
--connection-string="postgres://..."
```

Update `wrangler.toml` with the Hyperdrive ID that the command above returned.

**4. Deploy**  
Use `npm run dev` to test the app locally or `npm run deploy` to run the app on Cloudflare workers.

Thats it! You now have a globally accelerated multi-tenant application.

## Next steps

Create [Nile](https://console.thenile.dev) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) accounts and start shipping. You can read more about the integration in [Cloudflare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/nile/).
