If you look at many of the popular B2B applications that integrate AI capabilities, most of them use RAG architectures. Few examples:

- Zendesk uses solved tickets to power a copilot that assists the suppot team.
- Hubspot uses existing information about your customers and past interactions to generate personalized emails.
- Notion uses existing content to help draft and edit documents.

If you think about these examples (and there are hundreds more), you'll notice that they have additional pattern in common: These are multi-tenant applications, and in any interaction, they only retrieve data for the currect tenant.

This is obvious, when you think about it. No marketing team wants to send personalized emails based on customer's interactions with a different company. And Hubspot certainly can't allow this to happen on their platform. **Customer trust is the most important asset of B2B applications** and the addition of AI makes trust even more critical.

Multi-tenant RAG also has performance benefits. Indexing and searching vectors of a single customer is many orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than searching through all customers and then filtering the result. In many cases the number of vectors per customer is small enough that if you limit search to a specific customer, you can perform exact nearest neighbor search in a reasonable time, which means you benefit from perfect recall. As opposed to approximate nearest neighbor search, using indexes such as HNSW where you trade-off resources, latency and recall.

Multi-tenant RAG provides privacy, efficiency and accuracy. Now how do we build one?

### Multi-tenant RAG Architectures

Multi-tenant RAG is a popular pattern, so many vector stores provide some kind of solution for multi-tenancy. Sometimes have more than one option. Unfortunately, comparing them can be a bit challenging: There is no standard terminology for multi-tenancy in vector stores, so identical solutions can have different names in different vector stores.

If you've ever built any kind of multi-tenant application, you'll be familiar with these solution. Lets revisit the alternatives and the tradeoffs involved.

### DB per Tenant

On one end of the spectrum, there is the DB per tenant approach. This approach maximizes isolation and lets you treat each tenant as an individual pet with individualized care. It is a good fit if you have a relatively small number of high-paying customers. It has the following tradeoffs:

- **Resource inefficiency**: Even the most active tenant imaginable doesn't use all the resources allocated to a database. Significant portions of memory and CPU are used for maintaining the database - internal data structures, compaction processes, statistics, etc. In multi-tenant databases, this overhead is amortized among all tenants. With a database per tenant, you pay for this overhead for each tenant.
- **Client inefficiency**: With DB per tenant approach, you need to maintain a connection pool for each tenant for their database. This adds complexity to the application code as well as bloats the memory used by the application. In many cases, developers who choose this architecture also deploy an isolated application stack for each tenant.
- **Reporting**: If you do need to run any query across all your tenants (lets say, activity report for billing), you'll need to write a script that queries across all these databases and then aggregates the result. You'll likely need to build a data warehose and ETL process much sooner than you would in the case of multi-tenant database.
- **Administration**: Any admin operation, such as upgrades or even schema migrations, will need to run across all databases.

### Tenant column

At the other end of the spectrum, you place all tenants in the same DB and use the same tables (sometimes called collections) for all tenants. A `tenant_id` column (also called field) will be used to determine which row and vector belog to which tenant. Developers are expecte to add a filter to each query that will limit the responses to just the current tenant. This approach minimizes overhead and simplifies operations by letting you manage all tenants as identical cattle. It is a good fit if you plan for very large number (potentially millions) of small and price sensitive tenants.  
It has the following tradeoffs:

- **low isolation**: At the DB layer, tenants are not isolated at all. They share storage, memory, compute, network. Everything. If a developer codes carefully, you won't have any place where data is accidentally leaked between tenants, but this is the most you can guarantee.
- **lower scalability**: Building and re-building Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) indexes takes more time and resources when you need to index all the data for all tenants in a single index. Similarly, searching one giant index will take longer. Remember that you can't prune an ANN index based on another field before searching it, you are forced to search the entire index. This also means that the only way to filter data for a single tenant is to first find the nearest neighbors, then filter them based on the tenant, and keep iterating until you have sufficient vectors from that specific tenant.
- **no tenant-level admin**: Because all the tenants are placed in the same database, operations such as upgrades or restoring backups will always affect all tenants. If some tenants need to stay on an old version for some reason, this will be very difficult to solve.

### Hybrid options

The alternatives above represent two extremes - isolation and scalability on one side, ease of use and efficiency on the other. Some vector stores also offer alternatives between these two extremes. This involve putting tenants in the same database and adding isolation by separating tenants into their own schema (also called namespaces), tables (aka collections) or partitions. Each one of these options provide additional isolation but also some additional downsides. These options also have limits on the number of tenants, because they all represent additional objects in the database. The limits will range from few thousands to around 100,000, depending on the exact solution and on the database.

## Multi-tenant RAG with Nile and pgvector

Nile is Postgres, re-engineered for multi-tenant applications. When you use Nile, you'll notice that the developer experience is very similar to the "tenant column" architecture. You'll have a `tenants` table and you will need to add `tenant_id` column to each table that holds tenant-specific data or vectors. So you get this familiar experience.

However, behind the scenes, Nile stores tenant's data in their own virtual tenant databases and handles the routing of queries to the right destination. This way, Nile enforces isolation and provides additional capabilities such as placing tenants on dedicated or shared compute. In order to provide these capabilities, Nile checks that developers follow policies such as: "every insert must specify the tenant ID" and "mixing different tenants in one transaction is not allowed", these rules are guardrails that help developers build secure and private applications.

These capabilities are supported by Nile for any table and any type of data. For vectors, Nile integrates with `pgvector` - Postgres popular vector type. `pgvector` provides optimized vector types for both dense, quantized and sparse vectors, as well as various distance functions and vector indexes (flat, IVFFlat, HNSW).

Combining vector store with relational data is very powerful. You can:

- Query vector data using familiar SQL syntax
- Use your favorite clients, SDKs and ORMs on vector data
- Join vectors and documents with related data - relevant metadata, summaries, other documents with the same context.
- Efficient B-Tree indexes on metadata for additional filtering
- ACID compliance. You can store all related documents, metadata and embeddings in one transaction, to avoid missing or out of sync information.

If you take another look at the examples of multi-tenant RAG applications that I mentioned in the beginning of this blog: Zenefits, Hubspot, Notion. They all combine RAG with application data in seamless user experience. Using Postgres to store both application data and vectors is a simple and efficient way to implement the same experience.

Lets take a look at a few examples of using Nile for multi-tenant RAG. We'll implement the same similarity search in 5 different languages and frameworks.

In all these examples, we are building a smart task manager that uses past tasks, their time estimates and an LLM to estimate how long new tasks will take. To implement this, we insert tasks with embeddings and later search for similar tasks based on their embeddings. Naturally, we don't want to mix tasks between tenants.

### Using SQL

You can use Nile exactly as you'd use pgvector, except that you'll want to let Nile know which tenant you are working on.
For example:

```sql
-- creating a table to store wiki documents for a Notion like
-- SaaS application with vector dimension of 3
CREATE TABLE todos(
    tenant_id uuid,
    title varchar(256),
    embedding vector(3),
    estimate text
    );

-- store vector for a tenant
INSERT INTO todos (tenant_id,title, embedding, estimate)
VALUES ('018ade1a-7843-7e60-9686-714bab650998','feed the cat', '[1,2,3]', '5 minutes');

-- Find 10 nearest neighbors, but only for documents that belong to one tenant
SET nile.tenant_id = '018ade1a-7843-7e60-9686-714bab650998';

SELECT * FROM wiki_documents
ORDER BY embedding <=> '[3,1,2]'
LIMIT 10;
```

### Using Nile SDK (Typescript / Javascript)

Using Nile SDK is very similar. You still write plain SQL. Nile SDK will handle connection pooling and setting the tenant ID where needed:

```javascript
// grab a connection to a virtual tenant database
const tenantNile = await configureNile(params.tenantid);

// get similar tasks, no need to filter by tenant because we are already in the tenant context
const similarTasks = await tenantNile.db.query(
  `SELECT title, estimate FROM todos 
  ORDER BY embedding <-> $1
  LIMIT 10`,
  [embeddingToSQL(embedding)]
);
```

You can find full example applications using our SDK with [NextJS](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/AI-Native%20multi-tenant%20SaaS%20with%20Nile%20and%20NextJS) or [NodeJS](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/AI-Native%20multi-tenant%20SaaS%20with%20Nile%2C%20NodeJS%20and%20React).

### Using Drizzle (Typescript)

Drizzle is a popular Typescript ORM with great support for vector types. It is extensible, so you can wrap each transaction in a bit of code that injects the tenant_id. Once we do that, performing nearest neighbor search will look like this:

```javascript
const similarity =
  sql < number > `(${cosineDistance(todoSchema.embedding, embedding)})`;

// get similar tasks, no need to filter by tenant because we are already in the tenant context
const similarTasks = await tenantNile(async (tx) => {
  return await tx
    .select({ task: todoSchema.title, estimate: todoSchema.estimate })
    .from(todoSchema)
    .where(lt(similarity, 1))
    .orderBy((t: any) => desc(similarity))
    .limit(3);
});
```

We defined a similarity method - in this cosine distance between our document embedding and the embedding column in the table, and then use Drizzle client objects to build and execute the query. If you are interested to try, we have a [full example application](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/AI-Native%20multi-tenant%20SaaS%20with%20Nile%20and%20Drizzle%20ORM) that uses Drizzle with Nile and pgvector.

### Using SQL Alchemy (Python)

SQL Alchemy is a Python ORM and works quite similarly to Drizzle. It integrates well with FastAPI, so tenant-specific connections are injected as dependencies into route handles that work with tenant data. With the tenant-specific connections, I can perform similarity search for each tenant as follows:

```Python
# get similar tasks, no need to filter by tenant because we are already in the tenant context
similar_tasks_raw = (
    session.query(Todo)
    .filter(Todo.embedding.cosine_distance(query_embedding) < 1)
    .order_by(Todo.embedding.cosine_distance(query_embedding)).limit(3))
return [{"title": task.title, "estimate": task.estimate} for task in similar_tasks_raw]
```

The `session` object is already set with the tenant ID, thanks to a tenant-aware middleware. We used `pgvector` integration with `sqlalchemy` to add `embedding` column to the `Todo` model with vector type. Then we can call its `cosine_distance` function as you see above.

You can browse the full example [here](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/AI-Native%20SaaS%20with%20Nile%20and%20Python).

### Using LlamaIndex (Python)

Nile has a LlamaIndex integration, which lets you create tenant-aware vector stores in LlamaIndex and use them with LlamaIndex's simple RAG SDK and workflows. You can really see how LlamaIndex simplifies things, because you never need to explicitly search for nearest neighbors. You initialize an index from a table on Nile, and simply prompt the LLM. LlamaIndex and Nile integration handle it all behind the scenes.

```Python
# Initialize an index from a table on Nile - this is done once when app starts
self.vector_store = NileVectorStore(
    service_url=os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"),
    table_name="todos_embedding",
    tenant_aware=True,
    num_dimensions=768
)
self.index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(self.vector_store)

# create a query engine for specific tenant, this is a light wrapper
query_engine = self.index.as_query_engine(vector_store_kwargs={
          "tenant_id": str(tenant_id),
      })

# Just prompt with the task you need to estimate
response = query_engine.query(
    f'you are an amazing project manager. I need to {text}. How long do you think this will take? '
    f'respond with just the estimate, no yapping.'
)
```

## Summing things up

In this blog, we explored how multi-tenant Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is used in AI-powered B2B applications like Zendesk, HubSpot, and Notion. These apps retrieve data specific to each tenant, ensuring both data isolation and improved performance. We dive into different multi-tenant RAG implementation strategies, from the extremes of DB per tenant to using a tenant column in a single database. We also showcase how Nile's Postgres-based solution combines the simplicity of tenant-column architecture with powerful isolation, enabling efficient and secure AI experiences. And we demonstrated its use in a variety of languages and frameworks.
