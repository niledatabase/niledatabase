I am excited today to announce that Nile is live today! Nile is a Postgres platform that decouples storage from compute, virtualizes tenants, and supports vertical and horizontal scaling globally to ship AI-native B2B applications fast while being safe with limitless scale. Nile is in public preview, and we look forward to all the feedback as we move towards GA. 

[Sign up](https://console.thenile.dev/) to Nile and get started today! Try our [quickstarts](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/getting-started/languages) or use one of our numerous AI [examples](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/getting-started/examples) or [use cases](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/getting-started/usecases).

Nileâ€™s goal is simple - **To be the best platform to build and scale multi-tenant AI applications.**

We are taking a new approach to building databases that have not been attempted before. We are virtualizing the concept of a customer (or tenant) into Postgres, making Postgres and its ecosystem perfect for creating B2B AI companies. We have been working on this for the past eighteen months, and we believe it is the fastest and safest way to develop AI-native B2B applications and scale globally.
