We are excited to announce that Nile databases are now available as first-party integration in Vercel. Starting today, when you deploy your apps in Vercel, you can also provision a Postgres database for them with a click, right from Vercel dashboard itself.

## What's included in the integration?

- **One click provisioning of Postgres databases**. Create a databases for your team right from Vercel's dashboard and connect it to any project.
- **Automatic environment setup**. The database connection information and credentials are automatically added to the project's environment variables. No more wondering whether you copy-pasted correctly.
- **Unlimited free databases**. Provision as many databases as you need - per project, per env or even per branch. Nile's free tier includes unlimited databases and unlimited tenants. You only pay for running queries and storing data beyond the tier limits.
- **One stop shop for your app**. Manage databases, usage metrics and billing right from Vercel dashboard.
- **Query editor**. Need to quickly query your database? Click "Open in Nile" and start using our query editor to directly access your database.
- **Nile's multi-tenant features**. Tenant isolation for data and vectors, automatic scaling, flexible placement of tenants on shared or dedicated compute across regions, tenant insights and fully serverless developer experience.

## Using Vercel and Nile together

1. In Vercel workspace, click on the **storage** tab and then on **Create Database**. Select Nile, and choose region and pricing tier. Click **Create**.

2. You'll see the new database in the storage tab. You can now connect it to any project by clicking "Connect Project" and picking the project. This will populate the database connection in the project's environment. Alternatively, you can go into the storage tab of any project and pick an available database:

3. Re-deploy the project in order to read the new environment variables. 

Thats it. Its hard to imagine databases getting any easier.

## Next steps

Easiest way to get started is by deploying a template. Try Nile's [multi-tenant NextJS template](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/AI-Native%20multi-tenant%20SaaS%20with%20Nile%20and%20NextJS) 
or perhaps something more exciting like our [Autonomous Code Assistant](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/Autonomous%20Code%20Assistant%20-%20Code%20more%2C%20type%20less). If you want more detailed documentation about the integration, you can find it in our [docs](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/partners/vercel).
