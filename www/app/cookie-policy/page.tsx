          <strong>“Nile”</strong>, <strong>“we”</strong>, <strong>“us”</strong>{" "}
          or <strong>“our”</strong>) uses cookies and similar technologies in

          and that posts or links to this Cookie Notice (collectively, the{" "}

          If you want to manage these cookies, you can do so by visiting the Do

        <h2 className="has-text-align-left">What are cookies?</h2>

        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different
          purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting
          you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences,
          and generally improving your browsing experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close
          your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer
          or mobile device until you delete them).
        </p>

        <p>
          We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies,
          served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use
          to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our
          Sites; and (2) third-party cookies, which are served by service
          providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these
          parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits
          other websites. Third-party cookies can be used for a variety of
          purposes, including site analytics, advertising, and social media
          features.
        </p>

        <h2>
          What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies do we use on
          the Sites?
        </h2>

        <p>
          On the Sites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies in the
          following categories.
        </p>

        <h2> • Strictly Necessary cookies:</h2>

        <p>
          These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be
          switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to
          actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as
          setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You
          can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but
          some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store
          any personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use these strictly necessary cookies to identify you as being
          logged in to the website and to authenticate you, to make sure you
          connect to the right service on the website when we make any changes
          to the way it works and for security purposes.
        </p>

        <h2> • Performance cookies:</h2>

        <p>
          These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can
          measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know
          which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move
          around the site and gather information on error messages. All
          information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore
          anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you
          have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its
          performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use performance cookies to perform web analytics and for error
          management purposes, by measuring any errors that may occur.
        </p>

        <h2> • Functional cookies:</h2>

        <p>
          These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and
          personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers
          whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these
          cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use functional cookies to enable us to provide you with enhanced
          functionality and personalization. These cookies may be set by third
          party providers whose services we have added to our pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Other technologies:</h2>

        <p>
          In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as
          Flash technology to pixel tags to collect information automatically.
        </p>

        <h3>Browser Web Storage</h3>

        <p>
          We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as
          locally stored objects (“LSOs”), for similar purposes as cookies.
          Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data
          than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your
          browser web storage.
        </p>

        <h3>Web Beacons</h3>

        <p>
          We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and
          clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the
          actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike
          cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile
          device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or
          within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that
          a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically
          to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with
          our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that
          we can manage our content more effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Your choices</h3>

        <p>

          If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still
          see advertisements online, but they may not be relevant to you. Even
          if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online
          behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still
          receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that
          are not listed.
