        <h3>Notice to European users</h3>

        <p>
          Personal information. References to “personal information” in this
          Privacy Policy are equivalent to “personal data” governed by European
          data protection legislation. What is “personal data”? Essentially,
          personal data is information about an individual from which that
          individual is either directly identified or can be identified. It does
          not include ‘anonymous data’ (i.e., information where the identity of
          the relevant individual has been permanently removed and that
          individual is no longer identified or identifiable).

        <p>
          Controller. Nile Platform, Inc. is the controller of your personal

          above for contact details.

          Legal bases for processing. We use your personal information for the
          purposes listed below. In respect of each of the purposes for which we
          use your personal information, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we
          have a “legal basis” for that use. Our legal bases for processing the
          personal information described in this Privacy Policy are set out
          below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Use for new purposes. We may use your personal information for reasons
          not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the
          reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we
          need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we
          will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.
        </p>

        <p>

          <strong>Use for new purposes</strong>. We may use your personal
          information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where
          permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for
          which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for
          an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable
          legal basis.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Retention</strong>. We retain personal information for as long
          as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it,
          including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
          reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or fraud
          prevention purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
          information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
          personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use
          or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we
          process your personal information and whether we can achieve those
          purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we no longer require the personal information we have collected
          about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not
          possible (for example, because your personal information has been
          stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
          information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
          is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can
          no longer be associated with you), we may use this information
          indefinitely without further notice to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Sensitive personal information.</strong> We ask that you
          provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., social
          security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin,
          origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health,
          biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade
          union membership) on or through the services, or otherwise to us.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when
          you use the services, we will ask that you consent to our processing
          and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this
          Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of
          such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such
          sensitive personal information through our services.

          <strong>Cross-border data transfer.</strong> We may share your
          personal information with third parties who are based outside Europe.

        <p>
          We endeavor to ensure that people to whom we provide your personal
          information hold it subject to the standards required by European data
          protection legislation. So, whenever we transfer your personal
          information to a third party out of Europe, we try to ensure a similar
          degree of protection is afforded to it by making sure at least one of
          the following mechanisms is implemented
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Transfers to territories with an adequacy decision. We may transfer
            your personal information to countries or territories whose laws
            have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
            personal data by the European Commission or UK Government (as and
            where applicable) from time to time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Transfers to territories without an adequacy decision.
            </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We may transfer your personal information to countries or
                territories whose laws have not been deemed to provide an
                adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European
                Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable).
              </li>
              <li>
                What this means is that the relevant authority(ies) have not
                adopted an ‘adequacy decision’ to confirm that the relevant laws
                and practices in that country or territory are sufficient to
                ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data to the
                standards required by the GDPR – for example, there is currently
                no such decision in respect of the United States.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, in these cases:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    we may use specific appropriate safeguards approved by the
                    European Commission, the UK Information Commissioner’s
                    Office or UK Government (as and where applicable), which are
                    designed to give personal information the same protection it
                    has in Europe – for example, requiring the recipient of
                    personal information to enter into the relevant form of the
                    so-called ‘Standard Contractual Clauses’ issued or approved
                    from time to time; or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    in limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or
                    ‘derogation’, which permits us to transfer your information
                    to such country despite the absence of an ‘adequacy
                    decision’ or ‘appropriate safeguards’ – for example,
                    reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer.
                  </li>
