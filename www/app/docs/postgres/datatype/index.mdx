Postgres supports a wide range of data types for storing different types of data. In a table, each column has a data type,
and based on this data type, Postgres allocates storage and allows various operations. In this guide, we will cover some of the
most common data types and how to use them.

- [**Numeric Types**](datatype/numeric): Integers, floating-point numbers, and decimal numbers.
- [**Character Types**](datatype/character): Fixed-length and variable-length character strings.
- [**Date and Time Types**](datatype/date): Dates, times, and timestamps.
- [**Arrays**](datatype/arrays): Collections of values of the same type.
- [**Json**](datatype/json): Json representation for column values
