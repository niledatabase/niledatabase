# Using Array Types in Postgres

An array in PostgreSQL is a collection of elements with the same data type. It’s like a flexible container that can hold multiple values. Arrays can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional, allowing you to represent complex data structures within a single column.

## Declaration of Array Types

To create an array column in a table, use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sal_emp (
    name            text,
    pay_by_quarter  integer[],
    schedule        text[][]
);

```

In this example:

- `name` is a regular text column.
- `pay_by_quarter` is a one-dimensional array of integers, representing an employee’s salary by quarter.
- `schedule` is a two-dimensional array of text, representing an employee’s weekly schedule.

You can also use the `ARRAY` keyword for one-dimensional arrays:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tictactoe (
    squares integer[3][3]
);

```

Note that the array data type is named by appending square brackets (`[]`) to the data type name of the array elements. [The declared size or number of dimensions doesn’t affect runtime behavior; it’s mainly for documentation purposes1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/arrays.html).

## Array Value Input

To write an array value as a literal constant, enclose the element values within curly braces and separate them by commas:

```sql
-- Creating an array of integers
SELECT '{10, 20, 30}'::integer[];

-- Creating an array of text
SELECT '{"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"}'::text[];

```

## Accessing Array Elements

You can access individual elements of an array using the `[index]` syntax. The first element has an index of one:

```sql
-- Accessing the second element of an integer array
SELECT pay_by_quarter[2] FROM sal_emp;

```

## Modifying Arrays

Arrays are mutable. Use the `ARRAY[...]` constructor to create or modify arrays:

```sql
-- Adding a new value to an existing integer array
UPDATE sal_emp
SET pay_by_quarter = pay_by_quarter || ARRAY[40]
WHERE name = 'John Doe';

```

## Searching in Arrays

You can search for specific values within an array using operators like `ANY` or `ALL`:

```sql
-- Finding employees with a salary greater than 30 in any quarter
SELECT name
FROM sal_emp
WHERE 30 < ANY (pay_by_quarter);

```

## Array Functions and Operators

PostgreSQL provides a rich set of functions and operators for working with arrays. Some useful ones include:

- `array_length(arr, dim)`: Returns the length of the array along the specified dimension.
- `unnest(arr)`: Expands an array into a set of rows.
- `array_agg(expr)`: Aggregates values into an array.
- `@>` and `<@`: Tests if an array contains another array or value.
