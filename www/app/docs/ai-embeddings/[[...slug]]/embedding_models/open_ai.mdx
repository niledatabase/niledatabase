## Usage

### Generating embeddings with OpenAI

```javascript
// set up OpenAI
const { OpenAI } = await import("openai");
const OPENAI_API_KEY = "your openai api key";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY, // not necessary if you have this env variable
});

const MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"; // or text-embedding-3-large
const input_text = `The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their 
                    dreams.`;

// generate embeddings
let resp = await openai.embeddings.create({
  model: MODEL,
  input: input_text,
  dimensions: 1024, // OpenAI models scale down to lower dimensions
});

// OpenAI's response is an object with an array of
// objects that contain the vector embeddings
let embedding = resp.data[0].embedding;
```

### Storing and retrieving the embeddings

```javascript
// set up Nile as the vector store
const { Nile } = await import("@niledatabase/server");
const NILEDB_USER = "you need a nile user with access to a nile database";
const NILEDB_PASSWORD = "and a password for that user";
const nile = await Nile({
  user: NILEDB_USER,
  password: NILEDB_PASSWORD,
});

// store vector in a table
await nile.db.query("INSERT INTO embeddings (id, embedding) values ($1)", [
  JSON.stringify(embedding.map((v) => Number(v))),
]);

// search for similar vectors
let db_resp = await nile.db.query(
  "select embedding from embeddings order by embedding<=>$1 limit 1",
  [JSON.stringify(embedding.map((v) => Number(v)))]
);

// Postgres returns an object, with array of rows each column is a
// property of the row the vector is represented as a string
let similar_str = db_resp.rows[0].embedding;
let similar = similar_str
  .substring(1, similar_str.length - 1)
  .split(",")
  .map((v) => parseFloat(v));

// check that we got the same vector back
let same = true;

for (let i = 0; i < similar.length; i++) {
  if (Math.abs(similar[i] - embedding[i]) > 0.000001) {
    same = false;
  }
}

console.log("got same vector? " + same);
```

## Additional information

### Reducing dimensions

Using larger embeddings generally costs more and consumes more compute, memory and storage than using smaller embeddings. This is especially true for embeddings stored with `pg_vector`.
When storing embeddings in Postgres, it is important that each vector will be stored in a row that fits in a single PG block (typically 8K). If this size is exceeded,
the vector will be stored in TOAST storage which can slow down queries. In addition vectors that are "TOASTed" are not indexed, which means you can't reliably use vector indexes.

Both OpenAI's embedding models were trained with a technique that allows developers to trade-off performance and cost of using embeddings. Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings
(i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the dimensions API parameter.
Using the dimensions parameter when creating the embedding (as shown above) is the preferred approach. In certain cases, you may need to change the embedding dimension after you generate it.
When you change the dimension manually, you need to be sure to normalize the dimensions of the embedding.

### Distance metrics

OpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that you can use L2, cosine, and dot product similarity metrics interchangeably. Dot product is the fastest to compute.
