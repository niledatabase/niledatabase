1. Navigate to **Tenants & Users -> Configuration -> Email templates**.
2. Enter the name and SMTP settings for your custom server. The format should be `smtp://username:password@emailservice:587`, which would be provided by the email service
3. Enter an `app_name` and `sender`. These values will be used by the Nile auth to send your emails.

<Tip>Be sure that **`sender`** is a valid email address. Some email services will reject emails that do not have a valid sender address.</Tip>
