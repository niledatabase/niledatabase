<Step title="Prerequisites">
    Nile provides a cloud offering to help build multi-tenant apps. You can also get started with Nile's Docker image
    and try Nile locally. [Join our discord](https://discord.com/invite/8UuBB84tTy) to give feedback or ask questions about running Nile locally.

    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
    - Postgres client. We'll use `psql` in this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Run the Docker Container">

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -p 3000:3000 -ti ghcr.io/niledatabase/testingcontainer:latest
```

This will start a Postgres database with Nile extensions installed. It will also start Nile Auth (optional).
If this is the first time you are running the container, it will also pull the latest image,create the `test` database
and the `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` user.

</Step>
<Step title="Connecting to the Database">

You can use `psql` with the following connection string:

```bash
psql postgres://00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000:password@localhost:5432/test
```

Or, if you are using a different client, you use the following connection details:

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: test
Username: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Password: password
```

</Step>
