# @niledatabase/react

Nile ships a few common components with its react sdk, focused around user login and sign up. It is integrated with `@niledatabase/server` for API requests, or directly with your Nile database when using [Okta](../../../user-authentication/enterprise-login/okta) or [Google](../../../user-authentication/social-login/google)

## Installation

  <CodeGroups>
```node
npm install @niledatabase/react @niledatabase/server
```

```yarn
yarn install @niledatabase/react @niledatabase/server
```

</CodeGroups>

## Components

You can see a list of components and their configurations by visiting the [Nile database storybook](https://storybook.thenile.dev).

## Theming

The components use [@mui/joy](https://mui.com/joy-ui). @mui/joy is still in active beta, and the `<UserTenantList />` uses a component that has not fully been migrated yet, so [extending the @mui/joy theme is required](https://mui.com/joy-ui/integrations/material-ui/).

You can [see how the Nile storybook extends theming via github](https://github.com/niledatabase/nile-js/blob/main/packages/react/.storybook/themeConfig.ts).
