# Javascript SDK

Nile's Javascript SDK is a library that allows you to interact with the Nile API and Database from your Javascript app.

It is composed of two key packages:

- _[Server SDK](./javascript/server)_ allows you to interact with the Nile API and Database from your server-side Javascript app.
  It includes server-side libraries for working with Nile's authentication, user management and tenant management APIs.
  As well as a flexible query builder that seamlessly and efficiently works with Nile's virtual tenant databases.
  It is framework agnostic and can be used with any server-side or full-stack framework.
  We have examples for NextJS and NodeJS (with Express), and will add more framework examples in the future.
- _[React Components SDK](./javascript/react)_ has client-side React components that allow you to easily integrate Nile's functionality into your React app.
