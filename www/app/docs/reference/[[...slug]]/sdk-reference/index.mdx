Nile SDK is a collection of libraries that help you build applications on top of Nile.
It includes server-side libraries for working with Nile's authentication, user management and tenant management APIs.
As well as a flexible query builder that seamlessly and efficiently works with Nile's virtual tenant databases.

The JS SDK also includes React components that help you build user interfaces for your Nile applications.

Nile currently maintains a Javascript / Typescript SDK.
We plan to add support for additional languages such as Python, Java and Go.
We would love to hear from you if you have additional language requirements, other SDK requests or have issues getting started with Nile SDKs.
Join our [Github discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/niledatabase/discussions) or [Discord community](https://discord.gg/8UuBB84tTy) to discuss more.
