# Create a Developer

    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    Create a new developer account with an email address and password in a POST request to `https://api.thenile.dev/developers`.
    <CodeGroups
      title={"Create Developer Request"}
      method={"POST"}
      pathname={"/developers"}
    >
      ```bash
      curl 'https://api.thenile.dev/developers' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data-raw '{
        "email": "<string>",
        "password": "<string>"
      }'
      ```
    </CodeGroups>
    The response will include your developer id and email. Your password is never returned, and is stored as a salted, hashed credential.
    <CodeGroups
      title={"JSON Authentication Response"}
      response={"201"}
      pathname={"/developers"}
    >
      ```json
      {
        "id": "018b5dfd-63b7-7883-9442-4ce0be51caf8",
        "email": "your-email@your-domain.tld",
        "workspaces": []
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroups>

</div>

Once created, you'll need to [login with your credentials](/docs/reference/api-reference/developers/login-developer) in order to generate an access token to use in subsequent requests.

You'll notice the `workspaces` array is empty; this is because you haven't created any workspaces yet. You can create a workspace by calling the [Create Workspace](/docs/reference/api-reference/workspaces/create-workspace) endpoint.
