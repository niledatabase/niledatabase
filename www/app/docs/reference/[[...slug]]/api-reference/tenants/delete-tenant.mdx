# Delete a Tenant

Deleting a tenant through the API does not delete the tenant's data. Instead, it marks the tenant as deleted. The tenant will no longer be able to access the database, but the data will still be available in the database.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    Mark a tenant as deleted with a DELETE request.

    <CodeGroups
      title={"Delete Tenant Request"}
      method={"DELETE"}
      pathname={"/workspaces/:workspaceSlug/databases/:databaseName/tenants/:tenantId"}
    >
    ```bash
    curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.thenile.dev/workspaces/<string>/databases/<string>/tenants/<string>' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <string>'
      ```
    </CodeGroups>

    When a tenant is successfully marked as deleted, a response with status code 204 is returned.

    <CodeGroups
      title={"Delete Tenant Response"}
      response={"204"}
      pathname={"/workspaces/:workspaceSlug/databases/:databaseName/tenants/:tenantId"}
    >
    ```json
    ```
    </CodeGroups>

</div>
