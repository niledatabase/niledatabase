# Introduction

Describes basic concepts, response codes, authentication and rate limiting aspects of Nile APIs
With the API, developers can maange tenants (add, update or delete), create and delete databases, manage user lifecylce, implement authentication (basic auth, social logins and enterprise) and other management operations.

## Basic Concepts

The Nile API is built on REST architecture. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy.
All requests contain the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.thenile.dev
```

## Authentication

## Response codes

Nile uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

2xx HTTP codes correspond to success, 4xx codes are for user facing failures, and 5xx codes are for server side issues.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20x</td>
    <td>Successful Request</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>401</td>
    <td>Unauthorized</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>404</td>
    <td>Resource not found</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>409</td>
    <td>Resource already exist</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5xx</td>
    <td>Error on Nile servers</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Rate limiting

The API is currently subject to our terms of service. We could introduce rate limits in the future.
