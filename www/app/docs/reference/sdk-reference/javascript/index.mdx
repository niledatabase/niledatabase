# Javascript SDK

Nile's Javascript SDK is a library that allows you to interact with the Nile API and Database from your Javascript app. It is composed of two key packages:

### Server SDK

Nile's Server SDK allows you to interact with the Nile API and Database from your server-side Javascript app.
It includes server-side libraries for working with Nile's authentication, user management and tenant management APIs.
As well as a flexible query builder that seamlessly and efficiently works with Nile's virtual tenant databases.
It is framework agnostic and can be used with any server-side or full-stack framework.
We have examples for NextJS and NodeJS (with Express), and will add more framework examples in the future.
