We are in technical preview but would love to support and help developers build world class SaaS applications. We would love to hear feedback about the experience, the features, bugs and any other cool ideas you might have.

If you need help or have any questions, please reach out to us through one of the following options

1. Join the Nile [Discord](https://discord.gg/8UuBB84tTy) community to ask questions and discuss with other developers using Nile.
2. Participate in our [Github discussion](https://github.com/orgs/niledatabase/discussions) forum to request missing features or if you encountered a bug.
3. If you prefer a private conversation, you can send mail to support@thenile.dev.

You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/niledatabase) to get updates from us.
