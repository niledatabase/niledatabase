  <Step title="Test Nile Auth">
  Nile Auth service is running and listening on port 3000. We will do a curl to check if you can reach it and if it is returning the right information.
  The curl command queries the list of providers. By default, it should only have the email/credential option.

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/v2/databases/01000000-0000-7000-8000-000000000000/auth/providers
  ```

  Output:
  ```bash
  {"credentials":{"id":"credentials","name":"credentials","type":"credentials","signinUrl":"https://null/api/auth/signin/credentials","callbackUrl":"https://null/api/auth/callback/credentials"}}%   
  ```
  </Step>
  <CreateNextApp/>
  <Step title="Setup environment">
  Create a .env file in the next app folder that you just created and paste the values below. This will make the Next app that we just created use the local Nile Postgres and Nile Auth.
  ```bash
  NILEDB_USER=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  NILEDB_PASSWORD=password
  NILEDB_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/v2/databases/01000000-0000-7000-8000-000000000000
  NILEDB_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/test
  ```
