This guide will help you get started with Nile Auth by walking you through the steps required to configure and integrate authentication in your application using the provided SDK components. By the end of this guide, you will have implemented email + signup authentication (enabled by default for all databases), user profile, and organization management in your application.

<Step title="Bonus: Explore in Nile Console">

You can explore the database and the tenant management dashboard in the [Nile console](https://console.thenile.dev). 

You should see a new organization and new user created in the "Tenants and Users" section.
You can also navigate the the query editor and view the user and tenats in the database tables directly by running:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM tenants;
```

If you are feeling adventurous, you can try to replace the default user photo in their profile by running:

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET picture= 'https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/360000/velka/katze-katzchen-niedlich-vintage-1595638359oOf.jpg' 
WHERE email='your-dummy-email@example.com';
```

You should see the user photo updated in the user profile in your application.
