# Error Reference

A comprehensive guide to common errors in Nile Auth and how to resolve them.

## Authentication Errors

Authentication errors are errors that occur when a user attempts to authenticate with Nile Auth and something goes wrong.
In order to get the most information about the error, we recommend:

**Implement error handlers when using Nile Auth components**:

All errors caused by user input are returned as `200`, so you need to handle them in the `onSuccess` callback by checking if `res.ok` is `false`.
The error itself will be in the `res.text()` property. You can choose to display the error to the user, or silently handle it and log to the console. 
Check the [component guides](/auth/components/) for examples.

**Enable debug mode when instantiating Nile Server SDK**:

This will log everything that happens in the Nile Auth SDK, including detailed error messages.

```js
const nile = new Nile({
  debug: true,
});
```

Without debug logging, authentication errors will show as `400` errors in your server logs.

### Invalid Credentials

This typically happens when the user has entered an incorrect email or password. 
Use the error handler callback to display an error message to the user and implement a [password reset flow](/auth/email/password).

### User already exists

This happens when the user tries to sign up with an email that is already in use. They may have forgotten that they already have an account.
Use the error handler callback to display an error message to the user and direct them to sign in or reset their password.

### Invalid email

This happens when the user tries to sign up with an email that is not valid.
Use the error handler callback to display an error message to the user and direct them to sign up with a valid email.

## Configuration Errors

### Misconfigured environment variables

If you are missing any of the environment variables, you will get an error message in your server logs:
```
Error: User is required. Set NILEDB_USER as an environment variable or set `user` in the config options
```

Make sure you have set all the required environment variables:

```
NILEDB_USER=
NILEDB_PASSWORD=
NILEDB_API_URL=
NILEDB_POSTGRES_URL=
```
Review the [quickstart guide](/auth/quickstarts) for more information on how to set them up.

### Missing Social Provider Configuration

If you are missing the social provider configuration, but trying to use a social provider to sign in, 
you will be redirected to a fallback page with plain email and password sign in.

In order to use a social provider, you need to configure it in the [Nile Console](https://console.thenile.dev).
You can read more about the social providers in the [single sign-on guide](/auth/singlesignon/google).

### Invalid Social Provider Configuration

If you have incorrectly configured the social provider configuration, the user will see an error message from the provider 
which has some details about the error.

Review the error, the provider configuration in Nile Console and the configuration in the provider's developer console. 
Typically the issue is that the redirect URL in the SignOn component does not match the redirect URL in the provider's developer console.
