This guide will help you get started with Nile Auth and NextJS. This guide outlines the steps required to configure and integrate authentication in your application using the provided SDK components.

<Steps>
<CreateNextApp/>
<DbCreds/>
<InstallNile/>
<Step title="Use SDK Components">

Your application will interact with above authentication routes using SDK components. Replace the boilerplate `app/page.tsx` with the following:

`/app/page.jsx`
```jsx
import {
  SignOutButton,
  SignUpForm,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  TenantSelector,
  UserInfo,
} from "@niledatabase/react";
import "@niledatabase/react/styles.css";

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <SignedIn className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <UserInfo />
        <TenantSelector className="py-6 mb-10" />
        <SignOutButton />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignUpForm createTenant />
      </SignedOut>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Run and Log in to your application">

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to localhost to see the page. Enter a dummy email and password into the `<SignUpForm />`. This will automatically create a new user in the database and log you in. Congratulations, you have authentication!
