title: 'Nile-JS Tenants Module'
description: 'Managing tenants'
---

The Tenants module is used to manage tenants. It provides a number of methods for creating, updating, and deleting tenants. 
As well as adding and removing users from tenants.

## createTenant

The `nile.api.tenants.createTenant` method is used to create a new tenant.

### Parameters

- `name`: The name of the tenant to create. Nile does not enforce uniqueness of tenant names. You can have multiple tenants with the same name.

<Note>
The new tenant is automatically added to the current user's list of tenants.
</Note>

### Returns

- If successful, a promise that resolves to a `Tenant` object.

```ts
interface Tenant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```
- If unauthenticated, a promise that resolves to a Response object with 401 status code.
- Other failures return a promise that resolves to a Response object with 400 status code and a text body with the error message.

### Examples

```ts createTenant
const tenant = await nile.api.tenants.createTenant('My Tenant');
console.log(tenant);

// Tenant:  {
//  id: '019612d7-56e7-7e87-8f30-ad6b05d85645',
//  name: 'My Tenant',
//  created: '2025-04-08T00:40:24.557Z',
//  updated: '2025-04-08T00:40:24.557Z',
//  deleted: null,
//  compute_id: null
// }
```

## getTenant

The `nile.api.tenants.getTenant` method is used to get information about a specific tenant. A user can only access tenants that they are a member of.

### Parameters

- `id`: The id of the tenant to get.

### Returns

- If successful, a promise that resolves to a `Tenant` object.

```ts
interface Tenant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```
- If unauthenticated, a promise that resolves to a Response object with 401 status code.
- If the tenant is not found, a promise that resolves to a Response object with 404 status code.
- Other failures return a promise that resolves to a Response object with 400 status code and a text body with the error message.

### Examples

```ts getTenant
const tenant = await nile.api.tenants.getTenant('019612d7-56e7-7e87-8f30-ad6b05d85645');
console.log(tenant);

// Tenant:  {
//  id: '019612d7-56e7-7e87-8f30-ad6b05d85645',
//  name: 'My Tenant',
//  created: '2025-04-08T00:40:24.557Z',
//  updated: '2025-04-08T00:40:24.557Z',
//  deleted: null,
//  compute_id: null
// }
