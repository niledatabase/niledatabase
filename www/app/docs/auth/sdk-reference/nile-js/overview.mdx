The Nile-JS SDK is a toolkit for building multi-tenant applications with React, Next.js, Remix, Express, and more.
The React and web components are documented under [components](/auth/components). 
This reference is for the server-side SDK, which is used to build your server-side application logic.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @niledatabase/server 
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @niledatabase/server
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

The SDK is configured using environment variables. You can get these from the [Nile Console](https://console.thenile.dev):

<DbCreds />

## Initializing the SDK

The SDK is initialized using the `Nile` class. If you initialize the SDK without any arguments, it will use the configuration in the `.env` file.
You can also pass in a configuration object to the `Nile` constructor to override the configuration in the `.env` file. 
For more information about the available configuration options, see [configuration](/auth/sdk-reference/nile-js/configuration).

<Tip> The Nile object is a singleton. Initializing it multiple times in the same application will return the same instance. </Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```ts using env variables
import { Nile } from "@niledatabase/server";

const nile = await Nile();
```

```ts override config
import { Nile } from "@niledatabase/server";

const nile = await Nile({
    debug: true,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Available Modules

The SDK provides a number of modules with methods for interacting with Nile:
