# Magic Link Authentication

Magic Link authentication provides a passwordless sign-in experience where users 
receive a secure link via email to authenticate. This method eliminates the need for 
passwords while maintaining security.

## Overview

Magic Link authentication flow:
1. User enters their email address
2. They receive a secure link with an authentication token via email. The token is valid for 4 hours by default and is saved in the `auth.verification_tokens` table in your database. 
3. Clicking the link automatically exchanges the token for a session, logs them into your application and redirects them to the `callbackUrl` configured in the `sign` component.

## Implementation Steps

<Step title="Configure Email Settings">
Ensure you have configured your email settings in the Nile Dashboard. You'll need a valid 
[SMTP provider](/auth/email/customsmtp) configured to send emails from your 
application, and [email templates](/auth/email/templates) configured for the magic link.
