### Postgres Schemas

![marketingschema](/docs/marketingschema.png)

### 1. contacts

This table stores detailed information about contacts, including their email addresses, names, phone numbers, and additional descriptive notes. It helps in managing the contact base for marketing campaigns and ensures each contact is associated with a specific tenant.

```sql
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    tenant_id UUID,
    contact_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, contact_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(id)
);
```

### 2. campaigns

This table holds information about marketing campaigns, including the campaign's name, description, start date, and current status. It enables the management of various campaigns and associates each with a tenant. We track the embeddings for all the campaigns. The embeddings are generated from the campaign description. This helps the RAG architecture to make the AI propose similar campaigns that can be executed in the future and search the past campaigns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE campaigns (
    tenant_id UUID,
    campaign_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    start_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    vector_embedding VECTOR(768), -- Adjust the dimensions as needed
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, campaign_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(id)
);
```

### 3. campaign_contacts

This table maps contacts to campaigns, indicating which contacts are included in which campaigns. It supports many-to-many relationships between contacts and campaigns, allowing detailed campaign targeting.

```sql
CREATE TABLE campaign_contacts (
    tenant_id UUID,
    campaign_id UUID,
    contact_id UUID,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, campaign_id, contact_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns(tenant_id, campaign_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, contact_id) REFERENCES contacts(tenant_id, contact_id)
);
```

### 4. campaign_emails

This table records the details of the emails sent for each campaign, including the subject, body, and sent date. It helps track email communications and their association with specific campaigns. The embeddings are calculated from the email content. These are useful for the AI to draft future emails that had much better conversion, summarize emails and also help search through the past emails across campaigns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE campaign_emails (
    tenant_id UUID,
    campaign_id UUID,
    email_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    subject VARCHAR(255),
    body TEXT,
    sent_date TIMESTAMP,
    vector_embedding VECTOR(768), -- Adjust the dimensions as needed
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, campaign_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns(tenant_id, campaign_id)
);
```

### 5. campaign_analytics

This table tracks the performance metrics of each campaign, such as the number of emails sent, opened, links clicked, and conversions achieved. It provides insights into campaign effectiveness and is associated with a specific tenant and campaign.

```sql
CREATE TABLE campaign_analytics (
    tenant_id UUID,
    campaign_id UUID,
    analytics_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email_sent_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    email_opened_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    link_clicked_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    conversions INT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, campaign_id, analytics_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns(tenant_id, campaign_id)
);
```
