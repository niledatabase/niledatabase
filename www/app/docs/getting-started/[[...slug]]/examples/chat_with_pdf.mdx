In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Nile's tenant virtualization, user management and 
vector embedding features to build a SaaS application that allows users to search the PDF documents 
in an organization. The SaaS will allow users to upload a PDF document, and then ask questions about the document.
Using embeddings generated by OpebAI and stored in Nile, and a similarity search using pg_vector,
to provide GPT-3.5 context that will help answer the questions. The embeddings are stored per tenant and data and
workload is isolated to a tenant.

## 1. Create a database

1. Sign up for an invite to [Nile](https://thenile.dev) if you don't have one already
2. You should see a welcome message. Click on "Lets get started"
3. Give your workspace and database names, or you can accept the default auto-generated names.

## 2. Create a table with pg_vector extension

Once you created your database, you'll land in Nile's web-based SQL editor. Great place to create the
tables we need for this app. Lets start with the embeddings table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE "file_embedding" (
  "id" UUID DEFAULT (gen_random_uuid()),
  "tenant_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "file_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "embedding_api_id"  UUID NOT NULL,
  "embedding" vector(1024),
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "pageContent" TEXT,
  "location" TEXT,
  CONSTRAINT "file_embedding_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id", "tenant_id"),
  CONSTRAINT "file_embedding_file_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("file_id", "tenant_id") REFERENCES "file" ("id", "tenant_id")
);
```

This is a tenant-aware table that stores the embeddings of the PDF documents.
You can see that each row belongs to a specific tenant, and that the `embedding`
column is of type `vector(1024)`. Vector type is provided by the pg_vector extension for storing embeddings.
By storing embeddings in a tenant-aware table, we can use Nile's built-in tenant isolation to ensure that
information about PDFs won't leak between tenants.

## 3. Create metadata tables

We'll need few more tables to store information about the PDF documents, the conversations with them
and the users. Go ahead and create these.

```bash
CREATE TABLE "file" (
  "id" UUID DEFAULT (gen_random_uuid()),
  "tenant_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "url"      TEXT,
  "key"      TEXT,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "user_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "user_picture" TEXT,
  "user_name" TEXT,
  "isIndex" Boolean,
  "name" TEXT,
  "pageAmt" INTEGER,
  CONSTRAINT "file_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id", "tenant_id"),
  CONSTRAINT "unique_key_per_tenant" UNIQUE ("tenant_id", "key")
);

CREATE TABLE "message" (
  "id" UUID DEFAULT (gen_random_uuid()),
  "tenant_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "text" TEXT,
  "isUserMessage" BOOLEAN,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "user_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "user_picture" TEXT,
  "user_name" TEXT,
  "fileId" UUID,
  CONSTRAINT "message_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id", "tenant_id"),
  CONSTRAINT "message_fileId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("fileId", "tenant_id") REFERENCES "file" ("id", "tenant_id")
);

CREATE TABLE "user_subscription" (
  "id" UUID DEFAULT (gen_random_uuid()),
  "user_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "tenant_id" UUID NOT NULL,
  "stripe_customer_id" TEXT,
  "stripe_subscription_id" TEXT,
  "stripe_price_id" TEXT,
  "stripe_current_period_end" TIMESTAMP,
  CONSTRAINT "subscription_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id", "tenant_id"),
  CONSTRAINT "user_subscription_user_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("user_id", "tenant_id") REFERENCES users.tenant_users ("user_id", "tenant_id"),
  CONSTRAINT "unique_stripe_customer_id" UNIQUE ("stripe_customer_id", "tenant_id"),
  CONSTRAINT "unique_stripe_subscription_id" UNIQUE ("stripe_subscription_id", "tenant_id")
);

```

If all went well, you'll see the new tables in the panel on the left hand side of the query editor. You can also see Nile's built-in tenant table next to it.

### 3. Getting credentials

In the left-hand menu, click on "Settings" and then select "Credentials".
Generate credentials and keep them somewhere safe. These give you access to the database.

### 4. Setting up Google Authentication

This demo uses Google authentication for signup. You will need to configure this in both Google and Nile,
following the instructions in [Nile documentation](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/user-authentication/social-login/google).

### 5. Setting up 3rd Party SaaS

This example requires a few more 3rd party SaaS accounts.
You'll need to set them up and grab API keys to configure this example:

- [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com): Used for storing PDFs
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/): Used to generate embeddings of the uploaded documents and for the chat itself
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/): This is optional: The application has support for limited free tier and a powerful paid tier. You can learn more about [integrating Nile and Stripe in the integration guide](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/integrations/stripe).

### 6. Setting the environment

- If you haven't cloned this project yet, now will be an excellent time to do so. Since it uses NextJS, we can use `create-next-app` for this:

  ```bash
  npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/tree/main/examples/ai/ai_pdf nile-ai-pdf
  cd nile-ai-pdf
  ```

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`, and update it with your workspace and database name.
  _(Your workspace and database name are displayed in the header of the Nile dashboard.)_
  Fill in the username and password with the credentials you picked up in the previous step.
  And fill in the access keys for UploadThing and OpenAI.

- Install dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`.
