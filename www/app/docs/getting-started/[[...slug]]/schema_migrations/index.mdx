Schema migrations are a systematic way to manage and version database schema changes over time. They allow developers to evolve their database structure in a controlled, 
repeatable manner as an application's needs change. 

Schema migrations are useful for several reasons:

1. Version control: They provide a history of database changes, making it easier to track modifications.
2. Consistency: They ensure that all environments (development, staging, production) have the same database structure.
3. Automation: Migrations can be integrated into deployment processes, ensuring database updates are applied consistently.

Nile isn't opinionated about how you should manage schema migrations. You can use any migration tool you like, as long as it supports Postgres.

Below you'll find guides for using some of the most popular migration tools for Postgres.
