# Schema Migrations with Drizzle

export const metadata = {
  title: "Drizzle",
  order: 1,
};

Drizzle is a TypeScript ORM that supports Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite. It also has a CLI, `drizzle-kit`, for managing migrations and few other things.
This guide will show you how to use Drizzle Kit CLI to manage your schema migrations. We are going to assume that you already have a project set up with your
favorite Typescript framework.

## Start from example project

You can start by cloning a small example project that we've set up [here](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/tree/main/examples/migrations/drizzle).

Clone the repo and run `npm i` to install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase.git
cd examples/migrations/drizzle
npm i
```

This will install `drizzle-kit`, `drizzle-orm`, `dotenv`, and `pg-node` - all of which are needed for this guide. `pg-node` can be replaced with another postgres client like `postgres.js`.

To run this example, you'll need a .env file with a DATABASE_URL environment variable set to a postgres database.
You can copy the connection string from your Nile database home page.

## Configure Drizzle

Drizzle kit is configured via a `drizzle.config.ts` file, which you can find in the root of the example project.

Here's an example `drizzle.config.ts` file. You'll need to set the `schema` field to the path to your schema file,
and the `out` field to the path where you want to store your migrations. The `dialect` field is the database you're using, in our case it's `postgresql`, and
the `dbCredentials` field is the credentials to your database. You typically want to use an environment variable for your database credentials.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./src/db/schema.ts",
  out: "./db/out",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url:
      process.env.DATABASE_URL ||
      "postgresql://username:password@db.thenile.dev:5432/db",
  },
});
```

## Code-first Schema management

In code-first schema management, you define your schema as Typescript objects, and then use the Drizzle Kit CLI to generate a migration that you can run against your database
to update your database schema accordingly.

### Example Schema Definition in Drizzle

The scehma definitions for your application live in `src/db/schema.ts` (or if you choose a different location, you'll need to update the `drizzle.config.ts` file).
Note that we include the built-in `tenants` table that Nile automatically provisions for you in your database. While the table is pre-provisioned, we want to create
the Drizzle object for it so that we can interact with the table in our application - for example to create a new tenant.

```javascript
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";
import {
  pgTable,
  primaryKey,
  uuid,
  text,
  timestamp,
  varchar,
  boolean,
  vector,
} from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const tenants = pgTable("tenants", {
  id: uuid("id")
    .default(sql`gen_random_uuid()`)
    .primaryKey(),
  name: text("name"),
  created: timestamp("created"),
  updated: timestamp("updated"),
  deleted: timestamp("deleted"),
});

export const todos = pgTable(
  "todos",
  {
    id: uuid("id").default(sql`gen_random_uuid()`),
    tenantId: uuid("tenant_id"),
    title: varchar("title", { length: 256 }),
    estimate: varchar("estimate", { length: 256 }),
    embedding: vector("embedding", { dimensions: 768 }),
    complete: boolean("complete"),
  },
  (table) => {
    return {
      pk: primaryKey({ columns: [table.tenantId, table.id] }),
    };
  }
);
```

### Generating a Migration

Now that we have our schema defined, we can generate a migration using Drizzle Kit.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
```

If all goes well, you'll see something like this:

```bash
âžœ  drizzle git:(drizzle_migrations) âœ— npx drizzle-kit generate
...
2 tables
tenants 5 columns 0 indexes 0 fks
todos 6 columns 0 indexes 0 fks

[âœ“] Your SQL migration file âžœ db/out/0000_absurd_captain_britain.sql ðŸš€
```

You can open the generated file in the `db/out` directory and see the SQL that Drizzle will run against your database to make the changes specified in your schema.

## Running Migrations

To run the migration, you can use the Drizzle Kit CLI again.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

If you don't see any errors, you've successfully run your migration.

### Seeding and Querying Data

Now that we have our schema defined, we can write some code to insert data into our database and query it.

If you run the example with `npx tsx src/index.ts` you should see the following output:

```bash
New tenant created!
New todo created!
Getting all todos from the database:  [
  {
    id: 'd8896674-a7eb-4405-a4de-4ad6fbd2f5fc',
    tenantId: '01929704-3250-70bf-9568-0a6858dfd4e9',
    title: 'My New Todo',
    estimate: null,
    embedding: null,
    complete: null
  }
]
```

The code that produces this output can be found in `src/index.ts`. As you can see, we initialize a connection to our database using the `drizzle` object
and then use the schema objects that we defined in `src/db/schema.ts` to seed and query our database.

```javascript
import 'dotenv/config';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { todos, tenants } from './db/schema';

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
async function main() {

  const tenant: typeof tenants.$inferInsert = {
    name: 'My New Tenant',
  };

  const tenantId = await db.insert(tenants).values(tenant).returning({ id: tenants.id });

  console.log('New tenant created!')

  const todo: typeof todos.$inferInsert = {
    title: 'My New Todo',
    tenantId: tenantId[0].id,
  };

  await db.insert(todos).values(todo);

  console.log('New todo created!')

  const rows = await db.select().from(todos);
  console.log('Getting all todos from the database: ', rows)
}

main();
```

This will create a new tenant and a new todo, and then query for all the todos in the database.

### Schema Changes

Now lets say that you want to add a new column to the `todos` table. You would make the following change to your schema:

```javascript
// ...
    complete: boolean("complete"),
    dueDate: timestamp("due_date"), // new column!
// ...
```

Now you can generate and run a new migration as follows:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

This will generate a new migration file in the `db/out` directory, which will look something like this:

```bash
ALTER TABLE "todos" ADD COLUMN "due_date" timestamp;
```

And apply the changes to your database.
