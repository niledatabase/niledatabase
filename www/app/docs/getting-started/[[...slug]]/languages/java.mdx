# Build a Java application with Nile

In this tutorial, you will learn about Nile's tenant virtualization features, while building a todo list application with Java, Spring Boot 3 and Hibernate.

## 1. Create a database

1. Sign up for an invite to [Nile](https://thenile.dev) if you don't have one already
2. You should see a welcome message. Click on "Lets get started"
   ![Nile welcome.](/docs/nile-welcome.png)
3. Give your workspace and database names, or you can accept the default auto-generated names. In order to complete this quickstart in a browser, make sure you select to ‚ÄúUse Token in Browser‚Äù.

## 2. Create a table

After you created a database, you will land in Nile's query editor. Since our application requires a table for storing all the "todos" this is a good time to create one:

```sql
create table todos (
    id uuid,
    tenant_id uuid,
    title varchar(256),
    complete boolean);
```

You will see the new table in the panel on the left side of the screen, and you can expand it to view the columns.

See the `tenant_id` column? By specifying this column, You are making the table **tenant aware**. The rows in it will belong to specific tenants. If you leave it out, the table is considered shared, more on this later.

## 3. Get credentials

In the left-hand menu, click on "Settings" and then select "Credentials". Generate credentails and keep them somewhere safe. These give you access to the database.

## 4. Set the environment

Enough GUI for now. Let's get to some code.

If you haven't cloned this repository yet, now will be an excellent time to do so.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase
cd niledatabase/examples/quickstart/java
```

Copy `src/main/resources/application.example` to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and fill in the details of
your Nile DB.

It should look something like this:

```bash
spring.datasource.jdbc-url=jdbc:postgresql://db.thenile.dev:5432/funky_giraffe
spring.datasource.username=018a6b69-b1e9-7574-b8f3-efd5fe63d9bb
spring.datasource.password=d757518e-6d52-4bdb-b85f-f008c9f80097
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.jackson.serialization.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS=false
```

## 5. Build and Run the application

This example uses Maven as the build tool. So you'll build it like this:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

You should see the Maven build complete with the following output:

```text
 [INFO] --- spring-boot:3.1.0:repackage (repackage) @ todo-nile ---
 [INFO] Replacing main artifact /niledatabase/examples/quickstart/java/target/todo-nile-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar with repackaged archive, adding nested dependencies in BOOT-INF/.
 [INFO] The original artifact has been renamed to /niledatabase/examples/quickstart/java/target/todo-nile-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original
 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Now you can run the application:

```bash
java -jar target/todo-nile-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

You should see the application starting with the last line of output saying:

```text
 2023-09-16T16:56:38.685-07:00  INFO 16200 --- [           main] com.example.todowebapp.TodoWebapp        :
 Started TodoWebapp in 2.648 seconds (process running for 2.886)
```

This is a backend service that exposes REST APIs with the todo list functionality.
You can experiment with these APIs with `curl`:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/tenants' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"name":"my first customer"}'

# replace the tenant ID in the URL:
curl  -X POST \
  'http://localhost:8080/tenants/108124a5-2e34-418a-9735-b93082e9fbf2/todos' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"title": "feed the cat", "complete": false}'

curl  -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/tenants'

# replace the tenant ID in the URL:
curl  -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8080/tenants/108124a5-2e34-418a-9735-b93082e9fbf2/todos'

# you'll need to create another todo with another tenant to see anything different here
curl  -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8080/insecure/all_todos'
```

## 6. Check the data in Nile

Go back to the Nile query editor and see the data you created from the app.

```sql
SELECT tenants.name, title, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

You should see all the todos you created, and the tenants they belong to.

## 7. How does it work?

There are a few moving pieces here, so let's break it down. If you are already familiar with Spring, this should mostly look familiar.

The application starting point is in `src/main/java/com/example/todowebapp/TodoWebapp.java`.
It's a Spring Boot application, so it has a `main` method that starts the application.

Below it, you will see that we are defining a `DataSource` bean.
We've extended the standard Hikari data source to add a `TenantAwareDataSource` decorator, which we'll soon explain.

```java
  HikariDataSource dataSource = new TenantAwareDataSource();
```

In the same file, you can also see that we are configuring the Web MVC framework to use the `TenantInterceptor`, which we are also about to dive into.

```java
  registry.addWebRequestInterceptor(new TenantInterceptor()).addPathPatterns("/tenants/{tenant_id}/**");
```

By using tenant aware data source and interceptor, we are making sure that every request and every database query is associated with a tenant end to end.

### 7.1 The `TenantInterceptor`

This is a Spring MVC interceptor. It is responsible for setting the `nile.tenant_id` context on every request.
It parses the request path and extracts the tenant ID from it, then it stores it in `ThreadLocalContext`.
The `ThreadLocalContext` is a simple class that stores the tenant ID in a `ThreadLocal` variable and provides some utility methods for access.

```java
  public void preHandle(WebRequest request) throws Exception {
      // We are getting the Tenant ID from the path parameters.
      // Another way would be to parse a JWT and extract the Tenant ID from the Claims in the Token.
      // Or to use a header like `X-TenantID`
      Map pathVariables = (Map) request.getAttribute(
              HandlerMapping.URI_TEMPLATE_VARIABLES_ATTRIBUTE,
              RequestAttributes.SCOPE_REQUEST);
      String tenantParam = (String) pathVariables.get("tenant_id");
      UUID tenantId = UUID.fromString(tenantParam);
      ThreadLocalContext.setTenantID(tenantId);
  }
```

Once the interceptor sets the tenant ID, it is set for the entire request handling path.
The `TenantAwareDataSource` will use it to set the `nile.tenant_id` context on every connection it returns.

### 7.2 The `TenantAwareDataSource`

This is a decorator for the standard Hikari data source. It is reponsible for providing our web application with a connection to the correct tenant database.
It does this by wrapping `getConnection` and setting `nile.tenant_id` context on the connection before returning it.
This means that every connection is associated with a specific tenant, and any queries executed on it will be scoped to that tenant.

This is Nile's "virtual tenant databases" feature in action.

```java
  public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
      Connection connection = super.getConnection();


      try (Statement sql = connection.createStatement()) {
          // This makes sure the connection is to this tenant's "virtual DB"
          // Any query we run on this connection will only ever return data the belongs to this tenant
          ThreadLocalContext.getTenantID().ifPresentOrElse(
                  tenantID -> setContext(sql, "SET nile.tenant_id = '" + tenantID + "'"),
                  () -> setContext(sql, "RESET nile.tenant_id")
          );
      }

      return connection;
  }
```

### 7.3 Tieing it all together - handling a request for all todos for a tenant

The `TodoController` is the Spring MVC controller that handles the requests for the todo list.
Its method `getAllTodos` is the handler for `GET /tenants/{tenant_id}/todos`.
In order to return all todos for a specific tenant, it uses a very simple query:

```java
    public @ResponseBody Iterable<Todo> getAllTodos(@PathVariable UUID tenant_id) {
        return todoRepository.findAll();
    }
```

You should note that `todoRepository.findAll()` is a default method of the JPA Repository (Java's standard ORM layer, wrapping Hibernate in this case).
We did not have to implement any querying logic here.

Even though this query is identical to the one used in `insecureController`, it will only return the todos for the tenant that was requested.
This is due to the use of tenant interceptor on the request path, and the tenant aware data source that is used by the JPA repository.

## 8. Looking good!

üèÜ¬†Tada! You have learned the basic Nile concepts:

- [Tenant aware tables](TBD)
- Tenant context
- Tenant isolation
