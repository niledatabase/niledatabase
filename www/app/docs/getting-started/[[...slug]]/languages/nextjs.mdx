# Build a NextJS Application with Nile

In this quick tutorial, you will learn about Nile's tenant virtualization features, while building a todo list application with NextJS 13.

## 1. Create a database

1. Sign up for an invite to [Nile](https://thenile.dev) if you don't have one already
2. You should see a welcome message. Click on "Lets get started"
   ![Nile welcome.](/docs/nile-welcome.png)
3. Give your workspace and database names, or you can accept the default auto-generated names. In order to complete this quickstart in a browser, make sure you select to “Use Token in Browser”.

## 2. Create a table

After you created a database, you will land in Nile's query editor. Since our application requires a table for storing all the "todos" this is a good time to create one:

```sql
create table todos (
    tenant_id uuid,
    title varchar(256),
    complete boolean);
```

You will see the new table in the panel on the left side of the screen, and you can expand it to view the columns.

See the `tenant_id` column? By specifying this column, You are making the table **tenant aware**. The rows in it will belong to specific tenants. If you leave it out, the table is considered shared, more on this later.

## 3. Get credentials

In the left-hand menu, click on "Settings" and then select "Credentials". Generate credentails and keep them somewhere safe. These give you access to the database.

## 4. Set the environment

Enough GUI for now. Let's get to some code.

If you haven't cloned this repository yet, now will be an excellent time to do so.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase
cd niledatabase/examples/quickstart/nextjs
```

Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`, and update it with your workspace and database name.
_(Your workspace and database name are displayed in the header of the Nile dashboard.)_
Also fill in the username and password with the credentials you picked up in the previous step.

It should look something like this:

```bash
# Client (public) env vars

# the URL of this example + where the api routes are located
# Use this to instantiate Nile context for client-side components
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=http://localhost:3000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKSPACE=todoapp_demo
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE=demo_db_nextjs_qs

# Private env vars that should never show up in the browser
# These are used by the server to connect to Nile database
NILE_DB_HOST = "db.thenile.dev"
NILE_USER = "018ad484-0d52-7274-8639-057814be60c3"
NILE_PASSWORD = "0d11b8e5-fbbc-4639-be44-8ab72947ec5b"

# The URL of the Nile API
# Use this to instantiate Nile Server context for server-side use of the api SDK
NEXT_PUBLIC_NILE_API=https://api.thenile.dev

# Uncomment if you want to try Google Auth
# AUTH_TYPE=google
```

Install dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`.

### 5. Run the application

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If all went well, your browser should show you the first page in the app, asking you to login or sign up.

After you sign up as a user of this example app, you'll be able to see this user by going back to Nile Console and running `select * from users` in the query editor.

Login with the new user, and you can create a new tenant and add tasks for the tenant. You can see the changes in your Nile database by running

```sql
select tenants.name, title, complete from
tenants join todos on tenants.id=todos.tenant_id
```

## 7. How does it work?

There are a few moving pieces here, so let's break it down.

This example uses NextJS `app router`, so the application landing page is in `app/page.tsx`.
You can see the user authentication components `<GoogleAuthPanel />` and `<BasicLoginForm />` there.
If you are interested in learning how to use Nile for authentication, check out the [authentication tutorials](/docs/user-authentication).

This explanation will focus on creating tenants, selecting tenants and adding tasks.

### 7.1. Configuring Nile SDK

All the signup and login methods eventually route users to `/tenants`. You'll find the code in `app/tenants/page.tsx`.

The first thing we do in this page is to configure Nile SDK for the current user:

```typescript
configureNile(cookies().get('authData'), null);
```

This method configures a shared instance of `nile` that is used throughout the application.
This instance is a singleton, which you get by calling Nile SDK's `Server` method, which we are doing in '@/lib/NileServer'
This is also where all the environment variables we've set earlier are being used, so lets take a look at this file:

```typescript
const nile =  Server(
        ...
        api: {
          basePath: String(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NILE_API),
        },
        ...);
```

The `basePath` configuration is the URL that `nile.api` methods will call. This component calls Nile APIs directly, and therefore we set `basePath` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_NILE_API`.
Note that there are other components, for example basic login and signup that for web security reasons cannot call Nile APIs directly. Instead, they should call the application server, which in turn calls Nile APIs. In this case, the `basePath` should be set to `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`.

So every page, route and function in our app can use the same `nile` instance to access Nile APIs and DB. 

But, we need to make sure we are using the right user and tenant context.
So we call `configureNile` and pass in the cookies and the tenant ID. 
After this point, we can use `nile` to access the database and APIs, and it will use the right user and tenant context.

### 7.2 Listing tenants

Next thing we do in `app/tenants/page.tsx` is to list all the tenants for the current user.
We use Nile SDK to query the database for all the tenants that the current user is a member of:

```typescript
  tenants = await db("tenants")
    .select("tenants.id", "tenants.name")
    .join("users.tenant_users", "tenants.id", "=", "tenant_users.tenant_id")
    .where("tenant_users.user_id", "=", nile.userId);
```

and then we render the list of tenants as a list of links:

```typescript
<List variant="outlined">
  {tenants.map((tenant: any) => (
    <ListItem key={tenant.id}>
      <ListItemButton component={NextLink} href={`/tenants/${tenant.id}/todos`}>
        {tenant.name}
      </ListItemButton>
    </ListItem>
  ))}
</List>
```

It looks a bit like magic, but [NextJS server fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-server-with-third-party-libraries) and Nile SDK are integrated together to make this happen.

### 7.3 Creating a tenant

When you click on the "Create Tenant" button, we pop out a modal form. The form is defined in `app/tenants/add-form.tsx` and uses [NextJS server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/forms-and-mutations).
Create tenant logic is in `app/tenants/tenant-actions.tsx`.

In `createTenant` method, we use Nile SDK to create a new tenant and link it to the current user.

```typescript
  configureNile(cookies().get('authData'), null); // we don't have a tenant yet

  let tenantID = null;
  try {
    const createTenantResponse = await nile.api.tenants.createTenant({
      name: tenantName,
    });
  }
```

This call inserts a new tenant to `tenants` table, and also inserts a new row to `tenant_users` table, linking the current user to the new tenant.
You can see the new tenant in the Nile console by running `select * from tenants`.

By setting `nile.token = userToken` we are telling Nile SDK to use the user's token to make the API call. This is important, since Nile uses this token to both validate the user's identity and to link the tenant with this user.

### 7.4 Listing tasks

When you create a tenant or select an existing tenant, you are taken to the tenant's todo list.
The code for this page is in `app/tenants/[tenantid]/todos/page.tsx`.

We could have used the same logic to list todos for a tenant as we did for listing tenants for a user, but we wanted to show you a different way to do this.
Instead of using SQL `where` clauses to get only todos for this specific tenant, we are relying on Nile's tenant isolation feature:

```typescript
configureNile(cookies().get('authData'), params.tenantid);
const todos = await nile.db("todos").select("*"); // no need for where clause because we previously set Nile context
```

Note that this time we are configuring Nile with the tenant ID too. Previously we only used the user because there was no tenant yet.
Then we run a simple SQL query to get all the todos.

Behind the scenes, Nile does two things:

- Check that the user is a member of the tenant and indeed has access to these todos
- Apply tenant isolation and execute the query in a "virtual tenant DB".

This also means that you don't need to implement the 3-way join between `todo`, `tenants` and `tenant_users`, so the code is simpler and more performant.

### 7.5 Adding a task

When you click on the "+" to add a new task or on the checkbox to mark it as done, we again rely on NextJS server actions to make things simple.
You can find the logic for adding a task in `app/tenants/[tenantid]/todos/todo-actions.tsx`.

As you can see, we again use the tenant context to insert the new task:

```typescript
configureNile(cookies().get('authData'), tenantId);
await nile.db("todos").insert({tenant_id: nile.tenantId, title: title, complete: false})
```

or update an existing one:

```typescript
configureNile(cookies().get('authData'), tenantId);
await nile.db("todos").update({complete: complete}).where({title: title})
```

By setting the context, Nile will validate that the user indeed has permission to add tasks for this tenant, 
and will make sure we only update tasks for the current tenant.

We don't want just anyone handing us tasks and telling us to do them, right?

## 8. What's next?
