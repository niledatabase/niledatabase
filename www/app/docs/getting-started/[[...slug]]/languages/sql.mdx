## 1. Create a database

1. Sign up for an invite to [Nile](https://thenile.dev) if you don't have one already
2. You should see a welcome message. Click on "Lets get started"
   ![Nile welcome.](/docs/nile-welcome.png)
3. Give your workspace and database names, or you can accept the default auto-generated names. In order to complete this quickstart in a browser, make sure you select to ‚ÄúUse Token in Browser‚Äù.

## 2. Create a table

Lets imagine that we are building a todo list app and create our first table:

```sql
create table todos (
    tenant_id uuid,
    title varchar(256),
    complete boolean);
```

You will see the new table in the panel on the left side of the screen, and you can expand it to view the columns. If you are in `psql`, you can do `\d todos` in order to view the schema.

See the `tenant_id` column? By specifying this column, You are making the table **tenant aware**. The rows in it will belong to specific tenants. If you leave it out, the table is considered shared, more on this later.

## 3. Insert tenant

Nile ships with built-in tables, like `tenants` table that you used earlier. They are covered in more depth in our concepts documentation.

Meanwhile, lets insert a tenant into the built-in tenant table:

```sql
-- Creating my first tenant
insert into tenants (name) values ('my first customer');
select * from tenants;
```

Now, with the new tenant created, lets insert a record to the ‚Äútodos‚Äù table - don‚Äôt forget to include the `tenant_id`:

```sql
-- adding a todo item for this tenant
insert into todos (tenant_id, title, complete) values ('<tenant_id>', 'feed my cat', false);

SELECT tenants.name, title, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

If all went well, you‚Äôll see the first todo of your first customer üèÜ

```
name                 title          complete
---------------------------------------------
my first customer    feed my cat    f
```

## 4. Add another tenant

It is now time for our second customer and their todo item:

```sql
-- creating my second tenant
insert into tenants (name) values ('different customer');
select * from tenants;
```

```sql
-- a new todo item for our second tenant
insert into todos (tenant_id, title, complete) values ('<tenant_id_of_different_customer>',
'take out the trash', false);

SELECT tenants.name, title, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

If all went well, you now see the todo items for both customers:

```
name                 title                 complete
----------------------------------------------------
my first customer    feed my cat           f
different customer   take out the trash    f
```

## 5. Tenant isolation

Nile goes a step further and provides tenant isolation. You can set the session to a specific tenant, and every query that follows will only return data that belongs to this specific tenant.

Think of it as querying a virtual database dedicated to this one specific tenant.

You can select a tenant either from the drop-down list next to the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è¬†button. Or by setting the session parameter in SQL.

```sql
select * from tenants;
-- set context to isolate query to a specific tenant DB
-- our example uses the second tenant here
set nile.tenant_id = '<tenant_id>';

SELECT tenants.name, title, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

If all went well, you‚Äôll see the todo task for ‚Äúdifferent customer‚Äù and not the first customer:

```
name                 title                 complete
---------------------------------------------------
different customer   take out the trash    f
```
