# Build a NodeJS application with Nile

In this tutorial, you will learn about Nile's tenant virtualization features, while building a todo list application with NodeJS and React.

### 1. Create a database

1. Sign up for an invite to [Nile](https://thenile.dev) if you don't have one already
2. You should see a welcome message. Click on "Lets get started"
   ![Nile welcome.](/docs/nile-welcome.png)
3. Give your workspace and database names, or you can accept the default auto-generated names. In order to complete this quickstart in a browser, make sure you select to ‚ÄúUse Token in Browser‚Äù.

### 2. Create a table

After you created a database, you will land in Nile's query editor. Since our application requires a table for storing all the "todos" this is a good time to create one:

```sql
create table todos (
    id uuid DEFAULT (gen_random_uuid()),
    tenant_id uuid,
    title varchar(256),
    complete boolean);
```

You will see the new table in the panel on the left side of the screen, and you can expand it to view the columns.

See the `tenant_id` column? By specifying this column, You are making the table **tenant aware**. The rows in it will belong to specific tenants. If you leave it out, the table is considered shared, more on this later.

### 3. Get credentials

In the left-hand menu, click on "Settings" and then select "Credentials". Generate credentails and keep them somewhere safe. These give you access to the database.

### 4. Set the environment

Enough GUI for now. Let's get to some code.

If you haven't cloned this repository yet, now will be an excellent time to do so.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase
cd niledatabase/examples/quickstart/node_react
```

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
Update NILE_USER and NILE_PASSWORD with the credentials you picked up in the previous step. It should look something like this:

```bash
# This is the env vars for Node.js app.
NILE_DB_USER = "018b4937-2bbf-70fd-9075-37154198fa1e"
NILE_DB_PASSWORD = "358844ef-cb09-4758-ae77-bec13b801101"
NILE_WORKSPACE = "my_workspace"
NILE_DATABASE = "my_database"

# URL of the frontend, for the post-signup redirect
FE_URL = "http://localhost:3006"


# These end up in the user's browser, so don't put any secrets here.
REACT_APP_NILE_DATABASE = "my_workspace"
REACT_APP_NILE_WORKSPACE = "my_database"
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Run the application

Start both NodeJS api server and the React frontend

```bash
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 in a browser to see the app.

You can try a few things in the app:

- Sign up as a new user
- Create a tenant
- Create a todo task

### 6. Check the data in Nile

Go back to the Nile query editor and see the data you created from the app.

```sql
SELECT tenants.name, title, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

You should see all the todos you created, and the tenants they belong to.

### 7. How does it work?

The interesting part of this example is the NodeJS server. Lets take a look at [`/examples/quickstart/node_react/app.js`](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/blob/master/examples/quickstart/node_react/src/be/app.js).

The NodeJS server uses the [Nile JS client](https://github.com/niledatabase/nile-js) to connect to Nile.

The client is initialized with the credentials you provided in the `.env` file:

```js
export const nile = Server({
  workspace: String(process.env.NILE_WORKSPACE),
  database: String(process.env.NILE_DATABASE),
  db: {
    connection: {
      user: process.env.NILE_DB_USER,
      password: process.env.NILE_DB_PASSWORD,
    },
  },
});
```

The application uses Express middleware to capture the tenant identity for the current request and set Nile context:

```js
app.param("tenantId", (req, res, next, tenantId) => {
  nile.tenantId = tenantId;
  next();
});
```

We use Nile SDK to both execute SQL and make API calls to Nile. For example, to create as new tenant:

```js
app.post("/api/tenants", async (req, res) => {
  const { name } = req.body;

  const createTenantResponse = await nile.api.tenants.createTenant({
    name: name,
  });
  const tenant = await createTenantResponse.json();
  res.json(tenant);
});
```

The example uses Nile's tenant isolation to guarantee that each tenant can only see their own data:

```js
app.get("/api/tenants/:tenantId/todos", async (req, res) => {
  // No need for a "where" clause here
  // we are setting the tenant context in the middleware
  const todos = await nile.db("todos").select("*").orderBy("title");
  res.json(todos);
});
```

## 8. Looking good!

üèÜ Tada! You have learned the basic Nile concepts:

- [Tenant aware tables](https://www.notion.so/640f7364152a4941990cf6351b065049?pvs=21)
- Tenant context
- Tenant isolation
