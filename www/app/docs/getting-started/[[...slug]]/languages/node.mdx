# Build a NodeJS application with Nile

In this tutorial, you will learn about Nile's tenant virtualization features, while building a todo list application with NodeJS and React.

## 1. Create a database

1. Signup to [Nile](https://dev-nad.thenile.dev).
2. You should see a welcome message. Click on "Lets get started"
   ![Nile welcome.](/docs/nile-welcome.png)
3. Give your workspace and database names, or you can accept the default auto-generated names. In order to complete this quickstart in a browser, make sure you select to “Use Token in Browser”.

## 2. Create a table

After you created a database, you will land in Nile's query editor. Since our application requires a table for storing all the "todos" this is a good time to create one:

```sql
create table todos (
    tenant_id uuid,
    title varchar(256),
    complete boolean);
```

You will see the new table in the panel on the left side of the screen, and you can expand it to view the columns.

See the `tenant_id` column? By specifying this column, You are making the table **tenant aware**. The rows in it will belong to specific tenants. If you leave it out, the table is considered shared, more on this later.

### 3. Get credentials

In the left-hand menu, click on "Settings" and then select "Credentials". Generate credentails and keep them somewhere safe. These give you access to the database.

### 4. Set the environment

Enough GUI for now. Let's get to some code.

If you haven't cloned this repository yet, now will be an excellent time to do so. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase
cd niledatabase/examples/quickstart/node_react
```

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` 
Update NILE_USER and NILE_PASSWORD with the credentials you picked up in the previous step.

```
NILE_BASE_PATH = "https://dev.khnum.thenile.dev"
NILE_USER = "018a6b69-b1e9-7574-b8f3-efd5fe63d9bb"
NILE_PASSWORD = "d757518e-6d52-4bdb-b85f-f008c9f80097"
```

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 5. Run the application

Start both NodeJS api server and the React frontend

```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 in a browser to see the app. 

You can try a few things in the app

a. Create a new tenant.
b. Click on "Explore" next to one of the tenants and create a few todo items.
c. Browse through all the pre populated tenants and todo items

### 6. Check the data in Nile

Go back to the Nile dashboard and see the data you created from the app.
  
  ```sql
  SELECT tenants.name, title, complete
  FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
  ```

You should see all the todos you created, and the tenants they belong to.

### 7. How does it work?

The interesting part of this example is the NodeJS server. Lets take a look at [`/examples/quickstart/node_react/app.js`](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/blob/master/examples/quickstart/node_react/app.js).

The NodeJS server uses the [Nile JS client](https://github.com/niledatabase/nile-js) to connect to Nile. 

The client is initialized with the credentials you provided in the `.env` file:

```js
  export const { api, db } = Server({
  api: {
    basePath: String(process.env.BASE_PATH),
  },
  db: {
    connection: {
      user: process.env.NILE_USER,
      password: process.env.NILE_PASSWORD,
    },
  },
});
```

It has a friendly ORM-like API for interacting with the database. For example, creating a tenant is as simple as:

```js
  app.post('/tenants', async (req, res) => {
      const { name } = req.body
      const newTenant = await db('tenants').insert({
          name: name
      }).returning('id');
      res.json(newTenant)
    })
```

The example uses Nile's tenant isolation to guarantee that each tenant can only see their own data. 

```js
app.get('/tenants/:tenantId/todos', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { tenantId } = req.params

    // Query the database with tenant context, to guarantee that each tenant can only see their own data
    const todos = await db('todos').withTenant(tenantId).select('*');
    res.json(todos);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.log(error.message)
    res.status(500).json({
      message: "Internal Server Error",
    })
  }
})
```

## 8. Looking good!

🏆 Tada! You have learned the basic Nile concepts:

- [Tenant aware tables](https://www.notion.so/640f7364152a4941990cf6351b065049?pvs=21)
- Tenant context
- Tenant isolation
