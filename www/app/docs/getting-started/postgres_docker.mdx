## 

Nile provides a cloud offering to help build multi-tenant apps. You can also get started with Nile's Docker image
and try Nile locally. [Join our discord](https://discord.com/invite/8UuBB84tTy) to give feedback or ask questions about running Nile locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Postgres client. We'll use `psql` in this guide.

### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -ti ghcr.io/niledatabase/testingcontainer:v0.0.2
```

This will start a Postgres database with Nile extensions installed.
If this is the first time you are running the container, it will also pull the latest image,create the `test` database
and the `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` user.

### Connecting to the Database

You can use `psql` with the following connection string:

```bash
psql postgres://00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000:password@localhost:5432/test
```

Or, if you are using a different client, you use the following connection details:

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: test
Username: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Password: password
```

## Using the local database

From this point, you can use the local database just like you would use Nile service.
All the examples in the documentation are also applicable to the local database.
Below we'll go through the steps in the quickstart guide using the local database.

### Create a tenant-aware table

[Tenant-aware tables](https://thenile.dev/docs/tenant-virtualization/tenant-isolation) are tables that have
a `tenant_id` column. All the rows in such tables belong to a specific tenant.

Let us create our first table that has a tenant_id column and a vector column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "todos" (
  "id" uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  "tenant_id" uuid,
  "title" varchar(256),
  "estimate" varchar(256),
  "embedding" vector(3),
  "complete" boolean,
  CONSTRAINT todos_pkey PRIMARY KEY("tenant_id","id")
);
```

If you are using `psql`, you can view the table schema by running `\d todos`.

### Create tenants

Nile ships with built-in tables, like `tenants` table. Lets create our first tenant by inserting a row into the `tenants` table:

```sql
-- Creating the first tenant
insert into tenants (id, name)
values ('d24419bf-6122-4879-afa5-1d9c1b051d72', 'my first customer');
select * from tenants;
```

### Insert data into a tenant-aware table

Now that we have a tenant, we can insert data into our tenant-aware table:

```sql
-- adding a todo item for this tenant

insert into todos (tenant_id, title, estimate, embedding, complete)
values ('d24419bf-6122-4879-afa5-1d9c1b051d72', 'feed my cat', '1h', '[1,2,3]', false);
```

and you can verify the data was inserted correctly by running:

```sql
select * from todos;
```

You can add another tenant and insert data for that tenant in a similar fashion. This will allow us to explore
tenant isolation (in the next section).

```sql
-- creating my second tenant

insert into tenants (id, name)
values ('7e93c45f-fe65-4f26-8ab6-922850fa4c7a', 'second customer');
select * from tenants;

insert into todos (tenant_id, title, estimate, embedding, complete)
values ('7e93c45f-fe65-4f26-8ab6-922850fa4c7a', 'take out the trash', '2h', '[0.8,0.2,0.6]', false);
select * from todos;
```

### Tenant isolation

Nile goes a step further and provides tenant isolation. You can set the session to a specific tenant, and every query that follows will only return data that belongs to this specific tenant.

Think of it as querying a virtual database dedicated to this one specific tenant.

```sql
-- set context to isolate query to a specific tenant DB
-- our example uses the second tenant here
set nile.tenant_id = '7e93c45f-fe65-4f26-8ab6-922850fa4c7a';

SELECT tenants.name, title, embedding, estimate, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

✏️ Note that the container uses ephemeral storage, so all the data will be lost when the container is stopped.
This is intentional, as it simplifies the setup (and more importantly - the cleanup), while still allowing you to experiment and test your application.

### Looking good! What's next?

🏆 Tada! You have learned the key Nile concepts. And it only took 5 minutes.

You can learn more about Nile's tenant virtualization features in the following tutorials:

- [Tenant management](/docs/tenant-virtualization/tenant-management)
- [Tenant isolation](/docs/tenant-virtualization/tenant-isolation)

Next, you will probably want to learn how to use Nile for building an app in your favorite language.
Check out our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guides for more information.

## Optional: Docker container configuration

The docker container can be configured with the following environment variables:

- `NILE_TESTING_DB_NAME`: The name of the database. Defaults to `test`.
- `NILE_TESTING_DB_ID`: The ID of the database. Must be a UUID. Defaults to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
- `NILE_TESTING_DB_USER`: The username for the database user. Must be UUID. Defaults to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
- `NILE_TESTING_DB_PASSWORD`: The password of the database user. Defaults to `password`.

If you need to change the default values, you can do so by setting the environment variables when running the container.

```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 -ti \
  -e NILE_TESTING_DB_NAME=mydatabase \
  -e NILE_TESTING_DB_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  ghcr.io/niledatabase/testingcontainer:v0.0.2
```

with this configuration, the connection string will be:

```bash
psql postgres://00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000:mypassword@127.0.0.1:5432/mydatabase
```

You can also change the port mappings in the docker run command, if you want Postgres to listen on a different port.
