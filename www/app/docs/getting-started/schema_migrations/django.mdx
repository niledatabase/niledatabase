Django has built-in support for schema migrations. Below, we'll walk through the process of setting up a Django project 
with Nile and running your first migration.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install Django">

If you don't already have Django installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create a new Django project">

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

This will create a new Django project in the `myproject` directory.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a new app">

```bash
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

This will create a new Django app in the `myproject` directory.

If all went well, the `myproject` directory should now have the following structure:

```
myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    myapp/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
```
</Step>
<Step title="Setting up Nile Database">
Edit the `myproject/settings.py` file to include the Nile database URL:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "mydb",
        "USER": "myuser",
        "PASSWORD": "mypassword",
        "HOST": "us-west-2.db.thenile.dev",
        "PORT": "5432",
    }
}
```

You can find your database credentials in the Nile dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the migrations built-in migrations">

Django has several default modules that need database tables created. To create these tables, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This will create the tables in the database.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a new model">

In `myapp/models.py`, create a new model:

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

And update the installed apps in `myproject/settings.py` to include your app:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'myapp.apps.MyappConfig',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new migration">

To create a new migration, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations myapp
```

This will create a new migration file in the `myapp/migrations` directory.

</Step>

<Step title="Run the migration">

To run the migration, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This will apply the migration to the database.

Connect to your database and see a new table created, called `myapp_mymodel`.

</Step>

</Steps>
