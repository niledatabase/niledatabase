The 360 employee feedback application allows employees to provide feedback about their peers, receive feedback, and manage their own performance and recognition. The application supports feedback from any employee to any other employee within the company and includes AI-powered features to analyze feedback patterns, draft feedback, and provide insights. Employees can also give kudos and badges to each other, with options for anonymous feedback. The HR team can manage and review all feedback, with notifications to ensure timely completion of feedback tasks.

### Key Features

1. **Feedback Management:**
   - Employees can give feedback to any other employee.
   - Feedback can be given anonymously if desired.
   - Employees can view all feedback given to them.
   - Self-feedback is allowed.
2. **AI Features:**
   - AI can summarize feedback and provide insights into feedback patterns for specific employees.
   - AI can help draft feedback based on context or previous feedback.
   - AI can analyze feedback trends to suggest improvements or recognize strengths.
3. **Recognition:**
   - Employees can give kudos and badges to each other.
   - System tracks and manages all kudos and badges given.
4. **Notifications:**
   - Notifications for employees to provide pending feedback.
   - Alerts for HR and employees regarding feedback deadlines.
5. **HR Management:**
   - HR can view and manage all feedback across the organization.
   - HR can use AI to summarize and analyze overall feedback trends.

### Postgres Schemas

![feedbackschema](/images/feedbackschema.png)

### 1. departments

The `departments` table contains information about the different departments within an organization. Each department is uniquely identified by a `department_id` and is associated with a `tenant_id` to ensure it belongs to the correct organization. This table includes the department name.

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    tenant_id UUID,
    department_id UUID,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, department_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(tenant_id)
);
```

### 2. employees

The `employees` table tracks employee information within an organization. Each employee is identified by a unique `employee_id` and is associated with a department (`department_id`). This table includes details such as job title and compensation. The table is linked to the `tenant_id` to ensure that employee records are specific to each organization.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    tenant_id UUID,
    employee_id UUID,
    department_id UUID,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    compensation NUMERIC(15, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, employee_id) REFERENCES tenant_users(tenant_id, user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, department_id) REFERENCES departments(tenant_id, department_id)
);
```

### 3. feedback

The `feedback` table records feedback given by employees to other employees. It includes the `giver_id` (the employee giving the feedback) and `receiver_id` (the employee receiving the feedback), along with the feedback text. This table also tracks whether the feedback is anonymous and includes a `vector_embedding` for AI-based analysis. Each feedback entry is tied to a specific `tenant_id`. The embeddings can be used to help summarize and draft feedbacks.

```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (
    tenant_id UUID,
    feedback_id UUID,
    giver_id UUID,
    receiver_id UUID,
    feedback_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_anonymous BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    vector_embedding VECTOR(768), -- Adjust the dimensions as needed
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, feedback_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, giver_id) REFERENCES employees(tenant_id, employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, receiver_id) REFERENCES employees(tenant_id, employee_id)
);
```

### 4. self_feedback

The `self_feedback` table allows employees to provide feedback about themselves. Each record includes a unique `self_feedback_id`, the `employee_id` who provided the feedback, and the text of the feedback. This table includes a `vector_embedding` for AI analysis and is associated with a specific `tenant_id`. The embeddings can be used to help summarize and draft feedbacks.

```sql
CREATE TABLE self_feedback (
    tenant_id UUID,
    self_feedback_id UUID,
    employee_id UUID,
    feedback_text TEXT,
    vector_embedding VECTOR(768), -- Adjust the dimensions as needed
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, self_feedback_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, employee_id) REFERENCES employees(tenant_id, employee_id)
);
```

### 5. kudos

The `kudos` table tracks kudos given by employees to their peers. It includes a unique `kudos_id`, the `giver_id` (employee giving kudos), the `receiver_id` (employee receiving kudos), and the text of the kudos. A `vector_embedding` is included for AI analysis. The embeddings are used to help search past kudos by HR and understand correlation between feedback and kudos. Each entry is linked to a `tenant_id`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE kudos (
    tenant_id UUID,
    kudos_id UUID,
    giver_id UUID,
    receiver_id UUID,
    kudos_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    vector_embedding VECTOR(768), -- Adjust the dimensions as needed
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, kudos_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, giver_id) REFERENCES employees(tenant_id, employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, receiver_id) REFERENCES employees(tenant_id, employee_id)
);
```

### 6. badges

The `badges` table records badges awarded to employees. Each badge has a unique `badge_id`, is linked to an `employee_id`, and includes the badge's name and the date it was issued. This table helps track employee achievements and is specific to each `tenant_id`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE badges (
    tenant_id UUID,
    badge_id UUID,
    employee_id UUID,
    badge_name VARCHAR(100),
    issued_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, badge_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, employee_id) REFERENCES employees(tenant_id, employee_id)
);
```

### 7. notifications

The `notifications` table manages notifications sent to employees. Each notification includes a unique `notification_id`, the `employee_id` it is intended for, the text of the notification, and a timestamp for when it was created. The table also tracks whether the notification has been read. This table is linked to a specific `tenant_id`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    tenant_id UUID,
    notification_id UUID,
    employee_id UUID,
    notification_text TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, notification_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, employee_id) REFERENCES employees(tenant_id, employee_id)
);
```
