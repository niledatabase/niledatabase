Serverless applications are backend services that run on pay-per-use compute. 
Building applications with serverless architecture lets developers focus on their core logic instead of worrying about 
managing and operating servers or runtimes. The Serverless Platform is responsible for scaling the workload to meet traffic demand. 

Because serverless applications are easy to manage and deploy, they are a natural fit for running workloads on the edge, close to the end user.

Serverless applications are typically designed to be stateless and rely on a database to store and retrieve data. 
Nile, as a Serverless database, works well with serverless workload. 

To get started using Nile with serverless applications, you can check the examples and guides below.
