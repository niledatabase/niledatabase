Integrating your SaaS product with third-party services and frameworks is a crucial aspect of modern software development. As a serverless Postgres, Nile integrates with 3rd party systems at the data layer with extensible built-in tables and efficient connection management.

In this section, we provide comprehensive guides on integrating Nile with various third-party services and frameworks.
With these integrations, you can exchange data and functionality between your SaaS and 3rd party services for more streamlined workflows. Our integration guides are designed to make the process straightforward and effective.

To get started using Nile with popular services and frameworks, you can check the examples and guides below.

We would love to hear from you if you have any feedback or requests on our [Github discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/niledatabase/discussions) or [Discord community](https://discord.gg/8UuBB84tTy).
