SaaS applications often require users to log in to access their accounts and data. OAuth allows SaaS providers to implement secure user authentication without having to store user credentials. Instead, they can rely on identity providers (such as Google, Microsoft, or social media platforms) to verify user identities, making the authentication process more secure and convenient for users.

OAuth can be used to implement SSO in SaaS environments. With SSO, users can log in once to a central identity provider (e.g., an enterprise's authentication system) and then access multiple SaaS applications without needing to enter their credentials separately for each one. This simplifies the user experience and enhances security.

Nile provides the ability to integrate social logins with your tenants. We will continue to expand our support for more login options. We would love to hear your feedback or request new features on our Github discussion forum or Discord community.
