# Vercel

## Using Vercel and Nile together

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) provides the developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure high performance web applications.

Nile's NextJS examples such as the [AI-native Todo App](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/AI-Native%20multi-tenant%20SaaS%20with%20Nile%20and%20NextJS),
[KnowledgeAI](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/KnowledgeAI%20-%20PDF%20search%20assistant%20for%20your%20organization)
and [Code Assistant](https://www.thenile.dev/templates/Autonomous%20Code%20Assistant%20-%20Code%20more%2C%20type%20less) are all written in NextJS and deployed on Vercel.

In this guide we'll walk you through how to deploy the AI-native Todo App on Vercel.

### Setting Up Nile

Start by signing up for [Nile](https://console.thenile.dev/). Once you've signed up for Nile, you'll be promoted to create your first database. Go ahead and do so.
You'll be redirected to the "Query Editor" pageof your new database. This is a good time to create the table we'll be using in this example:

```sql
    CREATE TABLE todos (
        id uuid DEFAULT (gen_random_uuid()),
        tenant_id uuid,
        title varchar(256),
        estimate varchar(256),
        embedding vector(768), -- must match the embedding model dimension
        complete boolean);
```

Once you've created the table, you'll see it on the left-hand side of the screen. You'll also see the `tenants` table that is built-in to Nile.

Next, you'll want to pick up your database connection string: Navigate to the "Settings" page, select "Connections" and click "Generate credentials".
Copy the connection string and keep it in a secure location.
Then, navigate to the "general" settings page and copy the `API URL`.

### Setting Up Vercel

If you don't already have a Vercel account, go ahead and create one [here](https://vercel.com/). Pretty simple.

### Quickstart

You'll want to start by forking [Nile's github repo](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase). You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the screen.

After you sign up for Vercel, you'll have the option to connect your GitHub account. This will allow you to import a project directly from
GitHub. In this case, we'll be importing the Nile Todo App.

Once you connected your Github account, you'll see the fork you just created in the "Import project" screen. Click "Import".

You'll be redirected to the "Configure project" screen. There are few things we need to change:

1. **Project name**: Give your project a meaningful name. For example `nile-vercel-nextjs`.
2. **Root Directory**: Set the root directory to `/examples/quickstart/nextjs`
3. **Environment Variables**: We need to add several environment variables. You can add them manually, but the simplest way is to
   copy-paste the contents of [`.env.local.example`](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/blob/main/examples/quickstart/nextjs/.env.local.example),
   and replace the values with your own:

- You can find `NILEDB_USER` and `NILEDB_PASSWORD` in the connection string you copied in the previous step.
- `NILEDB_API_URL` is the URL you copied in the previous step.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is the URL of your app. This is based on the proect name. In our case it is `https://nile-vercel-nextjs.vercel.app`.
- And don't forget to fill in your AI vendor API key. While the example uses Fireworks as the AI vendor, you can use any other [AI vendor](../../ai-embeddings/embedding-models) that you like by replacing the URL and model names.

After you've added the environment variables, click "Deploy". Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete and visit the app URL to see your app in action.
Make sure you are using the same URL in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable as the one you are visiting, otherwise you'll get CORS errors.
You can sign up, create a tenant and start creating todos - watch the AI estimate the time it will take to complete each todo!

You've now deployed a smart todo list app, written in Next.js, that uses Nile as the database and Vercel as the serverless compute platform.
