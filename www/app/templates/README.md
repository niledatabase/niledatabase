## Adding a template

To add a new template, first create a new object in `/app/templates/template.ts`. Follow the comments for the best results.

Run `npm run build:www` from the root directory (or `npm run build:templates` from this directory).

Start up the dev server by running `npm run dev:www`. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/templates](http://localhost:3000/templates) to find your new template. Click on it to see details.
