      <>
        Nile is billed on query tokens for usage on serverless compute and on
        storage. In the near future, you will be billed on provisioned compute
        (coming soon) if you choose to use it for some of your
        tenants/customers. You get billed on the first of every month for the
        usage consumed. All billing happens at the workspace level.

    header: "Are the limits per workspace?",
    content: (
      <>
        Yes, most limits are per workspace. This enables us to provide unlimited
        DBs for free tier and you can decide how to distributed the total
        available limits across the DBs.

  {
    header: "What happens when I hit the limits of a tier?",
    content: (
      <>
        We will reach out to you when you are nearing your usage limits. You can
        typically pay for additional capacity without having to move to a higher
        tier. This is true even when you are on the free tier.

    header: "Do I get notified if I am reaching my usage limits?",
    content: (
      <>
        Yes, you will be notified when you are close to 70% of the limits for
        your current tier.

  {
    header: "How is your cost so low for serverless compute?",
    content: (
      <>
        Nile's serverless compute is truly multi-tenant. This enables us to
        provide the ability to charge for the exact cpu and memory utilized per
        query. This reduces the cost on an average by 10x over provisioned
        compute. We take care of providing isolation across tenants.You can
        place tenants on the serverless compute or provisioned compute (coming
        soon).

  {
    header: "Does my db pause in the free tier?",
    content: (
      <>
        No, the db never pauses. We don't have any cold start time on the free
        tier. This is because we have built our serverless compute to be
        multitenant that lets us provide 'always on' dbs for free tier users.
