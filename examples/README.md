# Learn Nile by Example

This is a collection of simple applications that show how to use Nile functionality.

The examples are organized by the Nile feature that they demonstrate and below that, by language or framework that the example app uses.

Each example has its own README that briefly shows how to run it, and links to additional resources.

## Available Examples

- **`quickstart`**: These examples demonstrate Nile's built-in tables, tenant-aware tables and virtual tenant databases. You can find examples in [NextJS](./quickstart/nextjs/README.md), [Node](./quickstart/node_react/README.md), [Python](./quickstart/python/README.md) and many more.
- **`ai`**: These examples show how to use Nile to build AI applications. You can find examples for [code assistant](./ai/code_assistant/README.md), [sales insight](./ai/sales_insight/README.md) and [knowledge ai](./ai/ai_pdf/README.md)
