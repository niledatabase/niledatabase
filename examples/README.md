# Learn Nile by Example

This is a collection of simple applications that show how to use Nile functionality.

The examples are organized by the Nile feature that they demonstrate and below that, by language or framework that the example app uses.

Each example has its own README that briefly shows how to run it, and links to additional resources.

## Available Examples:

- **`quickstart`**: These examples demonstrate Nile's built-in tables, tenant-aware tables and virtual tenant databases. You can find examples in [NextJS](./quickstart/nextjs/README.md), [Node](./quickstart/node_react/README.md), [Java](./quickstart/java/README.md)
- **`user_management`**: These examples show how to use Nile to signup and authenticate users, create new tenants, and build a simple user dashboard. You can find examples for [email login](./user_management/email_login/NextJS/README.md), [social login with Google](./user_management/social_login_google/NextJS/README.md) and [enterprise login with Okta](./user_management/sso_login_okta/NextJS/README.md)
