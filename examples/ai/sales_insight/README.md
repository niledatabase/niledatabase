## Getting Started

Sign up for an invite to [Nile](https://thenile.dev) if you don't have one already and choose "Yes, let's get started". Follow the prompts to create a new workspace and a database.

### 2. Create todo table

After you created a database, you will land in Nile's query editor. Time to create a table for storing all the "sales" data.
