Sales Rep: Good morning! This is Sarah from Verity Capital. How are you today?

Customer: Hi, Sarah. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?

Sales Rep: I'm doing great, thank you for asking. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. I understand you're currently exploring financial planning and investment options?

Customer: Yes, that's right. I've been looking into various options for retirement planning and also saving for my kids' college education.

Sales Rep: That’s excellent. At Verity Capital, we help clients like you develop comprehensive financial plans to meet their long-term goals. Could you share some of your primary concerns with your current financial strategy?

Customer: Well, I’ve been managing my investments on my own, but it's been quite overwhelming. The market volatility has me second-guessing every move, and I'm not sure if I’m adequately diversified.

Sales Rep: That’s a common concern. Market volatility can be quite nerve-wracking, especially when you're managing it on your own. How do you currently approach balancing risk and growth in your portfolio?

Customer: Honestly, I don’t have a clear strategy. I just try to pick what seems like solid opportunities and hold on, but it’s stressful and I feel like I'm missing out on better opportunities by not having a professional plan.

Sales Rep: Absolutely, it makes a huge difference to have a tailored plan and a professional guiding you. We offer personalized financial planning that takes your risk tolerance, future goals, and time horizon into account. Have you worked with a financial advisor before?

Customer: I did briefly a few years ago, but I felt like they were just trying to sell me products rather than provide real advice.

Sales Rep: I understand your concern. At Verity Capital, our approach is client-centered. We prioritize your needs and goals first, and we’re committed to providing transparent, unbiased advice. Would you be interested in scheduling a more in-depth consultation where we can draft a preliminary plan for you?

Customer: That sounds good. But I'm worried about the costs involved. Financial advisory services can be expensive, and I’m on a budget.

Sales Rep: That’s a valid point. Our initial consultation is complimentary, so we can discuss your needs and provide a clear picture of any potential costs upfront. We offer a range of service packages designed to fit different budgets without compromising on quality.

Customer: Okay, that sounds fair. How can we proceed with setting up this consultation?

Sales Rep: Great! I can schedule a meeting for you with one of our seasoned advisors. Would later this week work for you, say Thursday or Friday?

Customer: Friday works for me.

Sales Rep: Excellent. I’ll set up the meeting for Friday at 10 AM. You will receive a confirmation email shortly with all the details. Is there anything specific you’d like us to prepare or focus on during the consultation?

Customer: Just a clear strategy for retirement and education saving that considers market fluctuations. That would be helpful.

Sales Rep: We’ll be sure to cover that. Thank you so much for your time today. We’re looking forward to helping you achieve your financial goals.

Customer: Thank you, Sarah. I look forward to speaking with your advisor on Friday.

Sales Rep: Have a great day!

Customer: You too. Goodbye.

Sales Rep: Goodbye.
