**Sales Rep:** Good morning! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. My name is Sarah, and I'm with Verity Capital. How are you doing?

**Customer:** Hi, Sarah. I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?

**Sales Rep:** I'm doing great, thank you. So, I understand you're looking into some financial solutions for your business. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're hoping to achieve?

**Customer:** Sure. We're a mid-sized company, and we're trying to expand our operations. We need some funding options but want to avoid high-interest loans. It's been tough finding something that fits our budget and needs.

**Sales Rep:** I completely understand. Expanding a business is always exciting but can definitely come with its challenges. At Verity Capital, we have a range of funding options, and we focus on creating tailored financial strategies that align with your specific goals. Would you be open to discussing a custom financing plan?

**Customer:** Yeah, that sounds interesting. But I'm concerned about the hidden fees and long-term commitments that some companies sneak into their contracts. We've been burned before.

**Sales Rep:** That's a valid concern. Transparency is one of our core values at Verity Capital. All our terms are clearly laid out from the beginning, with no hidden fees. We also offer flexible terms so you can choose what works best for your business now and in the future. 

**Customer:** Okay, but what kind of interest rates are we talking about? And how quickly can we get the funds if we decide to move forward?

**Sales Rep:** Our interest rates are competitive and depend largely on the specifics of your business and the amount you're looking to finance. We conduct a thorough evaluation to get you the best rate possible. As for the timeline, once all documentation is in place, you could receive the funds within 7 to 10 business days.

**Customer:** That sounds promising, but I still need to discuss this with my business partner. 

**Sales Rep:** Of course, I understand the need to make informed decisions. How about I send you a detailed proposal outlining the potential rates, terms, and benefits so you both can review it? 

**Customer:** That would be great. 

**Sales Rep:** Perfect. I'll email you the proposal by the end of the day. Would it be okay if we scheduled a follow-up call for next week to discuss any questions you might have?

**Customer:** Sure, next Tuesday works for me.

**Sales Rep:** Excellent. I'll set up a call for next Tuesday at 10 AM. If any questions come up before then, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

**Customer:** Will do. Thanks for the information, Sarah.

**Sales Rep:** My pleasure. Talk to you soon!
