# Nile

**Nile is a Postgres platform that decouples storage from compute, virtualizes tenants, and supports vertical and horizontal scaling globally to ship AI-native B2B applications fast while being safe with limitless scale.** All B2B applications are multi-tenant. A tenant/customer is primarily a company, an organization, or a workspace in your product that contains a group of users. A B2B application provides services to multiple tenants. Tenant is the basic building block of all B2B applications.

## Features

- Unlimited Postgres databases, Unlimited virtual tenant databases
- Secure isolation for customer's data and embeddings
- Customer-specific vector embeddings at 10x lower cost
- Autoscale to millions of tenants and billions of embeddings
