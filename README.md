# Nile

**Nile is a Serverless Postgres for modern SaaS that virtualizes tenants to make it easy to achieve tenant isolation, user management, global tenant placement, tenant sharding, and many more SaaS capabilities.

Nile has built primitives in standard Postgres to make it world-class for SaaS use cases while keeping the standard behavior of Postgres intact. It provides a fully integrated solution and still preserves the complete flexibility and extensibility of Postgres. At its core, Nile’s Postgres is a tenant or customer-aware serverless database (the first of its kind) that will significantly speed up SaaS application development, reduce cost, and enable developers to build world-class applications.
