# Support Google Authentication with Next.js

Supporting social login is a great way to reduce the friction of signup, and Nile makes it easy to
add social providers to your application. This guide walks you through setting up Google as an
identity provider.

We're assuming you have a Nile database up and running. If not, [sign up for Nile][nad] and follow
the prompts to create a workspace and database. You'll also need a Google account and a
[Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for your application.

# Connect Your Google and Nile Accounts

To ensure a secure exchange, your Google project and Nile database need to know a little bit about
each other.

## Enable Google in Nile

1. Open your [Nile dashboard][nad], and select the database for your application.
2. Click on the **Identity Providers** icon in the side navigation.
3. Click on the Google tile and flip the **Enabled** toggle on.
4. The **Redirect URI** is the page in your application that Nile redirects to after a user
   authenticates, or when an error occurs. For this example, enter
   `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/handler`.
5. The **Component URL** is what you will provide to Google as the callback URL. Click the **Copy**
   button to copy it to your clipboard.

## Configure Google

1. Login to your [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and open the
   [credentials panel](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) for your Google Cloud
   project.
2. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
3. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web Application** and give it a name, like
   "Nile Integration".
4. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, paste the URL you copied from Nile, above.
5. Click **Create**. Google displays the **client id** and **client secret**. Copy these values—
   you'll provide them to Nile.

## Provide Client Credentials to Nile

1. Back in the Nile dashboard, enter the client id and secret that you obtained from Google.
2. Click **Save**.

With your Google and Nile accounts connected, your application can now authenticate users with
Google accounts.

# Clone and Install the Authentication Demo

You can test your Google configuration with our authentication demo. Install it from the command
line:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/examples/google-auth-nextjs google-auth-nextjs && cd google-auth-nextjs
```

and install dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`, and update it with your workspace and database name.

_(Your workspace and database name are displayed in the header of the Nile dashboard.)_

## The GoogleSSOButton

In `/app/page.tsx`, you'll find a `<NileProvider>` configured with those environment variables. This
wraps a `<GoogleSSOButton>` component from the Nile UI Kit. This component initiates an
authentication request to your Nile database, which redirects to the Google authentication screen.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className={styles.main}>
      <NileProvider
        workspace={String(process.env.WORKSPACE)}
        database={String(process.env.DATABASE)}
        basePath={String(process.env.NILE_BASE_PATH)}
      >
        <GoogleSSOButton />
      </NileProvider>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## The Auth Redirect Handler

When the user successfully authenticates with Google, they are redirected to the URL you provided
in your Nile configuration. In this example, that's `/api/auth/handler/route.ts`, which simply
echoes back the values that Nile sends you when an authentication attempt is resolved:

```ts
import jwtDecode, { JwtPayload } from "jwt-decode";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const event = formData.get("event");

  if (event === "AUTH_ERROR") {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: formData.get("error") }), {
      status: 500,
    });
  }

  try {
    const accessToken = formData.get("access_token") as string;
    const decodedJWT = jwtDecode<JwtPayload>(accessToken);

    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify(
        {
          token: accessToken,
          subject: decodedJWT.sub,
          audience: decodedJWT.aud,
          state: formData.get("state"),
          event,
        },
        null,
        2
      )
    );
  } catch (e) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(e as Error), { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

## Run the Demo

Run the app with `yarn dev` or `npm dev` to start the app, and open
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser. When
you click "Continue with Google", you'll be redirected to Google's authentication screen. After
successfully logging in, you'll be redirected back to the demo application's route handler.

You can verify that your user was created in the [Nile dashboard][nad]. Open the SQL editor for your
database and query the users table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users.users;
```

# Summary

Nile uses the standard [OpenID Connect protocol](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)
to authenticate users with Google, then creates corresponding users in your database. Your
application will receive information about the user and a Nile access token associated with the
user—see [Handling Auth Redirects]() for more on that.

Nile supports other authentication methods, like [SSO with Okta](). Or if you want to dig deeper
into querying user data, read [Querying as a User]().
